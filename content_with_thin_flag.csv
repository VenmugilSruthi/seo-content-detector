Follow these preventative cybersecurity tips for stronger security practices. Lexi Croisdale 5  min read Last updated October 1, 2025 Contents Cybersecurity is gaining more importance globally as technology continues to advance. The emphasis on security stems from the need for organizations to be prepared for when, not if, a data breach occurs. Unfortunately, human error is often the cause of breaches. Understanding how to combat cyberattacks is crucial, as protecting sensitive information is everyone's responsibility in our data-driven world. In honor of Cybersecurity Awareness Month , we’ve compiled the top security tips you can implement to be more secure. By incorporating these tactics, you decrease the likelihood of your information or actions causing a catastrophic breach. #1 Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) Multifactor authentication adds an extra layer of security by verifying a user's identity through methods like receiving a verification code or clicking a link when logging in. Enabling MFA is crucial because the absence of it increases your vulnerability to risks. “Attackers don’t break in; they log in,” said Joseph Avanzato, a forensics expert at Varonis, during a live session on understanding a threat actor’s mindset. Enable MFA for services that offer it and use an authenticator app if available. Report any unusual login attempts immediately. For organizations, it's best to require MFA and restrict the option to disable it. #2 Avoid org-wide sharing links. It’s tempting to create a link accessible to anyone, rather than just specific users, in the event that additional stakeholders need access. However, Microsoft reports that only 1% of org-wide permissions granted are actually used. A vast amount of business documents contain sensitive information that shouldn't be accessible to everyone in the org, let alone anyone on the internet. Removing the ability to create org-wide links can significantly reduce your org’s blast radius. In the average company, 157,000 sensitive records are exposed to everyone on the internet through SaaS sharing features, representing $28 million in data-breach risk. Rather than opting for an over-permissioned link, users should share files directly with those who need access to do their job and invite others to access on a case-by-case basis. #3 Be suspicious of links and unknown contacts. Social engineering and phishing tactics are still some of the most effective ways hackers gain access. Common signs of phishing include a peculiar sender address, a sense of urgency in the request, and prompting users to click a link. Phishing simulations are an effective way for organizations to educate teams on the impact of engaging with suspicious communications and encourage users to proactively look for scams. As a consumer or employee, it’s important to vet any unknown senders who contact you via text, email, and more. All it takes is one click to give threat actors keys to the data kingdom. #4 Report suspicious activity when it happens. To expand on tip number three, it’s not enough to shrug off a suspicious text message and call it a day. Most phishing attempts target more than one user in an organization, so if you receive one, report it to your IT department. Some companies have plug-ins within their email service or a dedicated inbox to forward suspicious activity to. Even a simple response to phishing attempts can backfire, so avoid engaging in any type of conversation. Additionally, never share information or make purchases without verifying the contact’s identity. #5 Not everyone needs to be an admin. Administrative access in cloud platforms like Salesforce is powerful. At many organizations, existing admins can grant access to others in these tools without IT oversight. This results in too many users having escalated privileges and access to sensitive information. In Varonis’ DSPM Snapshot Report , we found that 60% of an average company's administrative accounts do not enable MFA, making it easier for attackers to compromise internally exposed data. Many orgs are unaware of the shared responsibility model , which holds SaaS providers accountable for securing a platform's infrastructure and providing a highly available solution, while consumers are responsible for protecting and securing their data within. When someone in your organization requests admin access to an application you manage, assess if the request is justified and consider setting an expiration for the permissions to maintain security. Coordinate with your IT and security teams to ensure all administrators understand the shared responsibility model and adhere to the established permission protocols. #6 Assess the access you give third-party apps. Imagine signing up for the latest social networking app, and to bypass filling out a lengthy form, you can simply connect it to your Gmail account, thus opening up access to your information stored within this app. But while setting this connection up is easy, it’s challenging to understand how the apps are configured and what access they have to information stored in your connected service. There is also the risk that apps contain vulnerabilities that threat actors could exploit. Through a single click, access can be granted to these malicious applications. The Varonis Threat Labs team created an attack scenario in which we created a realistic-looking app and used a phishing technique to convince a user to install an app and grant full access to their Microsoft 365 environment. While our scenario was a simulation, most hackers and ransomware groups wouldn't stop at gaining access and would further exploit the information they find. As the use of third-party apps rises, it’s essential to assess your connected apps and the risks involved with them. We recommend analyzing the permissions for each app and ranking their risk level as low, medium, or high. With Varonis, organizations can see how many employees use a third-party app and view their activity levels via automation or manual reporting. To avoid breaches, users who haven’t opened a high-risk app in the last six months should have their permissions revoked. You may want to consider disconnecting the app altogether if it’s not being used. #7 Use public Wi-Fi networks with caution. As technology has evolved, the public expects access to Wi-Fi nearly everywhere they go, said Matt Radolec, Varonis’ Vice President of Incident Response and Cloud Operations, in an interview with CNBC . He added that users aren’t reading the terms and conditions or checking URLs when connecting to free Wi-Fi options, increasing their chances of compromise. “It’s almost a game to see how fast you can click ‘accept’ and then ‘sign in’ or ‘connect.’ This is the ploy, especially when visiting a new location; a user might not even know what a legitimate site should look like when presented with a fake site,” Matt said. Be cautious of free Wi-Fi networks you connect your device to, and make your computer forget them from your stored networks once you have finished your session. Get started with our world-famous Data Risk Assessment. Get your assessment #8 Be wary of what you share with gen AI tools. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can use your data to train their systems. If you share sensitive information during a chat, your data might unknowingly appear in another session or, even worse, in a hacker's hands. Tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot are also designed to access everything the user can, which is often far too much. Ensure your organization is ready to deploy AI tools safely before, during, and after rollout. Data privacy is a major concern regarding AI. Organizations recognize the need to safeguard privacy while maintaining AI functionality, which can be challenging. “We want to leverage LLM technology,” Varonis Security Architect Brock Bauer said during a webinar on LLM risks in the cloud . “We want to give the productivity capabilities to our users, but we also need to protect the privacy of the data they're accessing.” When using AI, always keep your sensitive details out of chats. Security teams should set up AI policies in their orgs and ensure employees are trained to properly use approved gen AI solutions. #9 Perform routine updates when prompted. It can be pesky to see an “automatic restart” window pop up right in the middle of an important task, but the longer you wait to update your computer, the more misconfigurations remain unpatched. Patches are solutions to vulnerabilities discovered in different software and cloud platforms. In 2021, our research team identified a bug in Salesforce dubbed Einstein's Wormhole . This bug exposed calendar events that could contain highly sensitive data such as attendee names, emails, meeting URLs, passwords, and replies being sent to organizers. Before the bug was patched, meeting information with potentially sensitive information was exposed to the entire internet. Being proactive with your device and software updates decreases the likelihood of being compromised due to a misconfiguration. #10 Use a password manager. Password managers let users create complex passwords for all their sign-ins, preventing threat actors from accessing their accounts. Whether you use a password manager or not, it is important to create different passwords for different sites, opt for additional security measures like MFA, and set up alerts when logins occur from unknown devices or locations. These small best practices for password generation can be key to preventing data compromise in a breach. Don’t wait for a breach to occur. With breaches on the rise, it’s crucial to prioritize cybersecurity. Following these preventative cybersecurity tips can help you have stronger security practices at work and at home. For organizations, pairing effective training with top-tier security technology creates an ideal cybersecurity solution. Want to learn more?

CIS SecureSuite® Membership Multi-State ISAC (MS-ISAC®) CIS CyberMarket® Vendors CIS Communities Our Partners Careers Home Insights Blog Posts 11 Cyber Defense Tips to Stay Secure at Work and Home 11 Cyber Defense Tips to Stay Secure at Work and Home Cybersecurity is inextricably tied to the technology it protects. Just as technology continues to grow in variety, quantity, and presence in all of our lives, so too does cybersecurity and our personal responsibility for it. You might be wondering how you can best act on this responsibility. The answer? Strengthen your cyber defense at home and at work. Provided below are 11 steps that you can use to get started. 1. Set Cyber Defense Priorities What are your cyber defense goals? Have you identified which devices and data you want to protect? What level of security do they need? By considering these and similar types of questions, you can start to formulate a cybersecurity roadmap that makes sense for you. 2. Think Before You Click Hover over a link to reveal the destination URL. If it looks different from the hyperlinked text, don’t click on it. It could be an attempt to trick you into visiting a phishing landing page. To protect yourself against phishing attacks, search instead for your intended website or enter the URL directly into your browser’s navigation bar. 3. Don't Get Phished Speaking of phishing, if you receive a suspicious email at work, don’t open or click on it. Instead, follow up with your IT and/or security department. How can you tell a suspicious email from a legitimate one? The former will often use a sense of urgency, including a sale, an emergency, or a negative consequence such as an account closure, to motivate you to click on a link or open an email attachment. Don't fall for it. If you come across this type of email, just stop, breathe, and forward it to your IT and/or your security department. If you receive this type of email on your personal device, delete the email and consider blocking the domain. Check out our short guide to phishing to learn more. 4. Go Beyond the Password Cyber threat actors (CTAs) can easily crack passwords like ""password,"" ""admin,"" or ""123456."" The same goes for dictionary-based passwords, or combinations made up of words that you can find in a dictionary. Instead of a simple password, try using a passphrase that sometimes substitutes numbers and symbols for letters. This unique approach can help you remember long strings for added security. As an example, consider the weak password “cheese” compared to the complex passphrases “1l0v3(h33s3” (modified from ""Ilovecheese"") or “m0r3(h33s3pl3@s3” (modified from ""morecheeseplease""). To properly secure your devices and data, protect your laptop, smartphone, and any other device you use with a secure passphrase such as the examples above. You can also consider using biometric passcodes if your device supports this option, or you can use a PIN or matric passcode for authentication. If you end up creating an alphanumeric passphrase with symbols, make sure you use unique combinations for each of your accounts. Remember that you can also generate passphrases using a password manager. The benefit there is that you can have the password manager remember each of your passwords so you don't have to. All you need to do is to protect access to your password manager with a strong passphrase and with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Check out our Password Policy Guide to learn more. 5. If It Matters, Use MFA To implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), you need to protect your account with authentication mechanisms from at least two of the following categories. Something you know: A passphrase or swipe pattern Something you are: Biometrics, fingerprint scanning Something you have: An authentication app on your phone or an ID badge Use a minimum of two-factor authentication (2FA) on any important accounts or computers where sensitive data is handled. That way, even if a CTA gains access to your username and password, they won't be able to access your account without the other factor(s). 6. Keep It Fresh Always install the latest updates for your operating system, browser, and any applications installed on your device. CTAs try to use known vulnerabilities to access your devices and/or other devices that are connected to the same network. Don’t let yourself (or your organization) become an easy target. 7. Reflect, then Connect Before you connect to an unfamiliar and/or public Wi-Fi network, think about the risks of doing so. What data might you share over the connection? To minimize the risk of data exposure, use a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN acts as a secure tunnel over the internet by creating an encrypted, private web connection. With a VPN, you can rest assured that your personal or work-related data is secure. 8. Shop Smart, Shop Secure Shopping online is a modern, everyday convenience. Protect sensitive banking data by only shopping on sites you trust. Never save your card information where it could be stolen and used later. Also, make sure to monitor your payment card records for unfamiliar charges. If you come across anything suspicious, reach out to the payment card issuer to dispute the charge and request a new payment card. 9. Avoid Configuration Confusion Configuration sounds like a big responsibility – and it's an important part of your security program. But it really comes down to the settings for a particular program or machine. Securely configure your computer, printer, smartphone, and other web-connected devices in your home and your office. 10. Don't Be the Bully When online, remember to be thoughtful and to use polite language. Sharing someone’s private personal information online, also known as ""doxxing,"" is never okay and may get you in legal trouble. 11. Charge with Caution Don’t plug your mobile devices into any outlet you find. Whether it’s a work or personal device, you could risk becoming the victim of juicejacking, a type of attack where CTAs compromise public USB charging stations to infect unsuspecting users with malware or data theft. If you’re worried about running out of battery, bring a back-up power bank or charge your device using your own charging cable and a wall outlet. Want even more tips to stay safe at home and at work?

New SaaS services come online, while innovative communication tools make remote working easier. Data storage methods shift, with new assets to secure. And new malware threats constantly emerge. In an ever-changing digital world, network security has never been more crucial. Network security is not a fixed constant. Methods to protect networks change all the time. In this glossary article, we will explain network security basics. We will introduce the CIA concept, and we will also look at contemporary security techniques. This article overviews the topic, but you can fine-tune your knowledge with detailed texts about related concepts. Key takeaways Networks are vital ecosystems with interconnected devices and applications, including workstations and servers, that form networks that perform key business functions. Network edge security is critical for defending against external threats, it involves securing digital and physical connections to the internet. Network types range from LANs for small areas to WANs and SD-WANs for larger regions and cloud security. Operating as Layer 3 of the OSI model, networks manage data transmission by creating and routing packets, often secured through encryption. Diverse network hardware includes servers, routers, switches, and firewalls, each integral to network functionality. Network monitoring and security involves tracking traffic and behavior to protect data and infrastructure, using various tools like firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. Comprehensive network security measures are a combination of strategies, including web gateways, email security, behavior monitoring, and VPNs, to fortify network security. The CIA triad model focuses on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information in network security strategies. What is a network? Networks are collections of devices and applications. When linked together, these assets serve core business functions. Network managers can place devices on different network segments, while they may also be geographically distant. But they are all part of the same workstations, servers, switches, and SaaS gateways community . What are the main network types? Networks come in a variety of types. Security measures required vary depending on network configurations. Common variants include: LAN – Local Area Networks or intranets are small community devices connected via one or more routing nodes. Router tools handle all network traffic and may also include internet interface modems. LAN networks can include many different devices. A LAN could feature computers, smartphones, printers, IoT devices, televisions, and gaming consoles. Routers assign IP addresses to all devices, which identify them on the network. WAN – Wide Area Networks are more common in modern business. They constitute collections of LANs and cover wide geographical areas. For instance, companies with several branches will usually connect them via WAN technology. The internet itself is defined as a WAN. Every ISP is also technically a WAN. SD-WAN – Software-defined Wide area networks are laid over WAN networks. Agents on connected devices link users to network resources. Managers can control access via secure gateways, and SD-WAN allows in-depth traffic monitoring. Companies also tend to use SD-WAN to secure cloud assets effectively. How do networks work? Networks operate at level 3 of the OSI model . The network layer is where data is transmitted. Servers create packets of information, which they send to network devices via routing devices. Packets are then rendered readable at the other end. Numerical IP addresses usually identify network devices. But more advanced network architecture uses text labels for the same purpose. Systems may also apply encryption to data passing over the network. Encryption conceals the contents of packets, protecting them against external observers. What are network devices? Network devices are any items of hardware connected to the network architecture. Every network should be documented and mapped. Mapping enables managers to understand which devices require protection. Company networks generally rely on several device types: Servers – store information and software. Hubs – link several devices together within the network. Routers - communicate information across the network. Switches – supplement the router and divert traffic efficiently. Bridges – connect network sections together. Workstations - connect to router devices and allow staff secure access. Gateways – connect areas of the network with different protocols or security profiles. Firewall equipment - guards network edges against malicious traffic. Access points – provide wireless access for authorized devices. What is network monitoring? Monitoring tools track traffic and user behavior inside the network perimeter. It also checks the status of network devices such as servers or switches and informs network managers when faults occur. Monitoring can be reactive or proactive. Proactive monitoring is preferable, anticipating problems and seeking threats before they cause damage. Monitoring can also be agent-based or agentless: Agent-based monitoring This form of monitoring installs software agents on every network client . Agents connect to centralized monitoring software. They provide a stream of data about the status of the device. This data could include memory usage and processes running on the device. Agents may track user connections or assess general performance. Agent-based monitoring delivers granular information and enhances network visibility . However, the proliferation of agents poses problems. Security teams must set aside time to update and log agents. Managing large communities of agents can be difficult for smaller organizations. Agentless monitoring This type of monitoring focuses on data passing across external and internal network connections . It involves packet inspection to discover information about data and network usage. And it can also involve app monitoring to ensure only authenticated users have access. Agentless monitoring is non-intrusive and requires few resources. It provides a data stream that can be used to improve security setups. But this information is generally not granular. Network managers may lack complete awareness of threats. Monitoring intervals Monitoring is not always constant. Instead, security managers schedule inspections of digital assets to assess functionality and security status. The gap between security inspections is the monitoring interval. Intervals vary depending on device type and situation. Technicians schedule constant inspections of the internal network. However, general network performance measurements may have longer monitoring intervals. This reduces the load placed on the network. What is network security and why is it important? Network security is the process of protecting networks against potential threats . It includes software and hardware designed to detect and block malicious agents. Securing networks also extends to access control, network organization, and security policies. Networking security is closely related to cybersecurity and information security . Cybersecurity guards against digital threats. InfoSec focuses on data protection. Both feed into protecting a single computer connected to the network infrastructure against outside threats. Network security matters because data and apps need protection . Businesses depend on reliable access to workloads and databases. However, they must secure confidential data from external observers via information security techniques. A well-thought-out security strategy balances access and protection while also meeting compliance goals. The main types of network security There are several networking security policy ingredients. Common approaches include: Firewalls – firewalls are the foundation of most security setups. They create a barrier between internal traffic flows and the external internet. Firewalls can also operate internally to create zones of trust, enforcing segmentation strategies that limit east-west traffic inside the perimeter. Access control – access control tools check all entry requests. Access management gateways ensure only users with the correct credentials can access network assets. Security policies define access levels. These policies describe the privileges of each user. They apply automatically when users try to access the system. Firewall protections also prevent illicit access. Application security – app security ensures the proper configuration of applications running on the network. The code of apps can be vulnerable to external attacks. For example, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in app code to access network resources. Application security tests all apps and applies patches to update code. Data loss prevention - proactively seeks to protect sensitive data. Data loss prevention tools log the location of critical data. They apply segmentation to guard that data against cybercriminals. Malware protection – anti-malware tools scan all incoming traffic for malicious code. Scanning can include network threats like spyware and ransomware. Both variants can extract data and lead to significant costs. Web gateways – Secure Web Gateways filter traffic entering and leaving the network. They use tools like DNS filtering to block unsafe websites and allow access to core web-based resources. Email security – specialist email security tools scan emails sent from work accounts. This includes emails passing through on-premises workstations as well as remote devices. Email clients also feature tools to filter spam messages from phishers. Behavior monitoring – security tools can monitor user behavior within the network perimeter. AI-assisted tools scan for abnormal traffic and access requests. Or they may check for access requests from unusual geographical locations. Virtual private networks – VPNs apply encryption to network traffic. Encryption guards data passing between remote workstations and network servers. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) – IPS allow managers to take a pre-emptive security approach. IPS tools check network traffic flows for malicious agents and suspicious activity, quarantining and recording threats that emerge and remove threats when detected. IPS tools generally use packet inspection, including protocol analysis. Signature Matching also helps to prevent exploit kit attacks. Network security controls Levels of control make securing networks easier to understand. There are three control levels. Companies should factor them all into their security strategies: Physical – physical security measures deal with the physical status of devices. Office devices may demand several credentials before permitting access. Companies must physically secure servers and other data storage devices via locks and access controls. Security setups may include cameras and biometric scanners to add extra assurance. Technical – these controls protect data flows across the computer network. They also guard data resting on network devices. Technical controls cover locally connected servers and workstations. But they also include remote working devices and SaaS services used by employees. They seek to prevent external attacks without harming network performance. Administrative – these controls deal with user behavior. Administrative controls include Identity and Access Management systems that check all access requests. Security policies set out privileges for each user. Systems onboard new hires and delete obsolete accounts to prevent credential theft. Staff training is also a major administrative challenge. Physical controls Technical controls Administrative controls Secure physical devices with multiple credentials for access Safeguard data flow within the computer network Manage user behavior through Identity and Access Management systems Locks and access controls protect servers and data storage devices Protect data on network devices, including servers and workstations Define user privileges with security policies Enhance security with cameras and biometric scanners Cover both locally connected and remote working devices Onboard new employees and remove obsolete accounts to prevent credential theft Ensure security without compromising network performance Provide staff training to address security challenges Understanding the CIA triad model The CIA model is the most popular way of visualizing security methods for modern networks. This model is the basis for defense-in-depth, which means defending connected assets across all network layers. “CIA” refers to the initials of the model’s core principles. These ideas include: Confidentiality – all sensitive information and user data must be protected and remain confidential. External attackers should not have access to network resources of any kind. Integrity – network managers retain complete control over application configurations. Only authorized admins can make code changes or set security policies. Network teams have total awareness of device connections and visibility of network traffic. Availability – resources should be available to authorized users at all times. Employees should be able to access workloads and transfer data from remote workstations. However, security tools must minimize the freedom of unauthorized users. Network managers must enforce all three CIA principles across the entire network. In practice, this means using several of the networking security approaches mentioned above. For example, traffic monitoring identifies which users access specific apps at a given moment. But it also means employing the right tools to achieve the CIA triad model. Network security tools The exact mixture of tools varies, but popular security options include: Load balancers A load balancer uses algorithms to determine traffic flows across the network. Traffic balancing helps to avoid bottlenecks but also has cybersecurity benefits. For example, load balancers can divert traffic when a service attack (or DDoS ) occurs. Sandboxes A sandbox operates alongside IPS tools to block aggressive malware actively. Sandboxes create emulated environments. These environments assess network traffic and can identify attack techniques like port scanning that other scanners often miss. NTA/NDR Network Traffic Analysis tools use AI to analyze network traffic. They compare real-time traffic to secure baselines. Baseline comparison allows traffic analysis tools to detect anomalies and report attacks before they cause harm. Find the right network security mix Robust networking security is the key to preventing data breaches and ransomware attacks. Follow the CIA model to create a comprehensive security strategy. Take into account physical, administrative, and technical controls. And choose agent or agentless monitoring to ensure total awareness.

Discover the types of network security and how it can help secure your networks. NETWORK ARCHITECTURE CHECKLIST 2025 THREAT LANDSCAPE REPORT Network Security Definition Network Security Solutions Related Technologies Network Security Trends Network Security FAQs Network Security Definition Network Security Definition Network Security Solutions Related Technologies Network Security Trends Network Security FAQs Network Security: Meaning & Definition Network security refers to the technologies, policies, people, and procedures that defend any communication infrastructure from cyberattacks, unauthorized access, and data loss, while upholding the principles of the CIA triad .In addition to the network itself, they also secure traffic and network-accessible assets at both the network edge and inside the perimeter. Click to See Larger Image How does network security work? Digital acceleration paved the way for business efficiencies, cost reductions, and productivity improvements. Yet, it has also led to an expanded attack surface across the growing network edge. From local area networks (LAN) and wide area networks (WAN) to the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, each new deployment results in another potential vulnerability. Worse yet, increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals are exploiting network vulnerabilities at an alarming rate. Malware , ransomware, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and countless other threats are challenging IT teams to fortify their defenses. Click to See Larger Image In turn, enterprises have much to gain by strengthening their network protections: Reduced cyber risk: Strong, robust security measures help ensure your data always stays protected. Enhanced data privacy: Eliminating threat vectors ensures sensitive information is shielded from unauthorized access while traversing the network, thereby safeguarding customer data , and maintaining compliance. Improved business continuity: Protected networks are more resilient against potential disruptions and experience minimal downtime, leading to optimal productivity. Better network performance: Security prevents bad actors from disabling the network, ensuring critical resources are always readily available. Essential Devices For Securing Network Infrastructure Hardware plays a vital role in securing the infrastructure. Three devices, in particular, are relevant to network security: Ethernet switches : Switching ensures adequate security at the network edge by facilitating traffic filtering and access control at the port level, allowing administrators to enforce policies on granular network segments. Wi-Fi access points (AP): Wireless APs implement encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms, protecting data in transit. They also support access control lists (ACLs), restricting unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. Gateways: 5G and LTE gateways are key to redundant and primary links to branch offices and campuses alike. Housing these devices under the same security umbrella as the rest of the network ensures common configuration, thereby reducing the attack surface. Network Security Solutions To Stay Ahead of Cyberthreats Discover key network security components to achieve secure digital acceleration. Download now Types Of Network Security Solutions 1. Firewalls Click to See Larger Image A firewall is a device that monitors, filters, and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. Acting as a barrier between trusted internal and untrusted external networks, it works by inspecting data packets and choosing to block or allow them. For example, a financial institution might configure its firewall to block traffic coming from unauthorized IP addresses while still allowing legitimate traffic to pass through. This mitigates a potential breach without interrupting core operations. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) is a modern iteration that goes beyond traditional solutions, incorporating deeper packet inspection for more robust protection. NGFWs often package many essential network security capabilities into one comprehensive offering, including intrusion prevention, antivirus and file sandboxing, web and DNS filtering, and more. With a hybrid mesh architecture — firewall’s next evolution — organizations can centralize control and visibility of formerly disparate tools. This makes it easier to coordinate and control policies across on-premise and cloud-based firewalls, not to mention multiple branches and campus locations. 2. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) Intrusion prevention systems detect and block known and suspected threats before they can impact the network core or devices at its edge. In addition to north/south and east/west deep packet inspection, including inspection of encrypted traffic, they can also provide virtual patching, which mitigates vulnerabilities at the network level. Using an IPS, organizations can rapidly detect attack signatures and abnormal behavior. The system automatically takes action to block malicious traffic while alerting administrators for further investigation. 3. Antivirus and sandboxing Antivirus and sandboxing tools are key to determining whether a file is malicious. While antivirus blocks known malware threats, sandboxing provides a safe environment to analyze suspicious files. Let’s say a user downloads a file from an email attachment. The antivirus software scans it for known attack signatures and behaviors. If it’s a confirmed threat, the software quarantines or removes the file. For an unknown file, sandboxing isolates it into a protected space where it can be tested to determine if it’s malicious. Some security vendors are leveraging these capabilities in concert with AI, allowing them to perform sub-second analysis of never-before-seen threats. 4. Web and DNS filtering Domain Name System (DNS) filtering allows organizations to stop domain-based attacks, such as DNS hijacking, tunneling, etc. Likewise, URL filtering prevents users and applications from accessing suspicious URLs, which could be linked to malicious websites. These web security tools help enterprises enforce acceptable-use policies while protecting them from harmful content. For instance, if a user attempts to access a malicious website, the web filter checks its database of categorized sites. If the domain has been flagged, it’ll block access entirely. 5. Attack surface management Some firewall solutions now include Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management tools that can help organizations automatically identify network IT, OT, and IoT assets, and assess those assets for potential risks. The tools can also assess existing security infrastructure and controls for misconfigurations and less-than-optimal settings that can then be updated to strengthen an organization’s security posture. 6. Remote access VPNs Remote access VPNs allow users to securely access the corporate network from outside their organization’s office. They create a private, encrypted connection from a public Wi-Fi network, enabling employees to safely use critical resources from their personal devices regardless of location. These solutions are especially useful in hybrid work environments, allowing remote workers to stay productive with the assurance their data is safe from malicious interception. 7. Network Access Control (NAC) Network access control governs access to the network, ensuring that only authorized and compliant devices gain entry. NAC solutions identify and authenticate devices, granting access only if they meet predefined compliance policies. For example, enterprises might configure their NAC to block certain device types. This prevents users from accessing the network on unprotected personal devices, but it also can help the company manage IoT and operational technology (OT) deployments. Hardware that fails to meet the criteria may be quarantined, redirected to a remediation network, or denied entirely. Related Network Security Technologies Although not directly supporting the network, there are related cybersecurity technologies that help protect the infrastructure: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Endpoint detection and response (EDR) security solutions continuously monitor all user and endpoint activities to protect them from threats and detect suspicious behavior. They also offer investigation and incident response capabilities, which eradicate the threat and isolate the affected system from impacting the rest of the network. Email security: Email security protects employees from cyber threats and social engineering attacks, including phishing, spear-phishing, and other email-based tactics. It works by examining inbound email to detect potential risk factors. For instance, it can identify communications that contain malware, suspicious links, questionable content and imagery, and other abnormalities — blocking the email from reaching the user’s inbox. Data Loss Prevention (DLP): DLP solutions identify sensitive information throughout cloud systems, mitigate accidental data sharing, and prevent data exfiltration. They increase visibility into data stores, helping enterprises track and remediate policy violations, thereby improving internal compliance. DDoS protection: DDoS protection defends against denial-of-service attacks, which aim to overwhelm the corporate network and disrupt operations. FortiDDoS , for example, rapidly inspects data packets and automatically blocks illegitimate traffic from flooding the network. Also read more about DDoS mitigation . Application security: Application security tools allow administrators to recognize traffic generated by well-known and custom applications. Using IPS protocol decoders, it analyzes traffic to identify applications, enabling admins to quickly form policies to allow, deny, or restrict access to specific apps or entire categories of them. This optimizes bandwidth utilization while also mitigating malware, unauthorized file transfers, and other risks. Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB): CASB solutions provide security to software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, users, and data. Inline CASB offers visibility, compliance, and threat protection for data in motion and at rest in cloud apps, but also creates shadow IT reports, risk assessments, and more. Application programming interfaces (APIs) allow open-architecture CASBs to directly integrate with SaaS providers.       This enables admins to scan cloud configurations, ensuring their users are monitored and protected no matter what       device they’re using. Benefits & Challenges of Network Security 5 Key Benefits of Network Security Here are the five key benefits of network security. 1. Protecting Sensitive Data & Preventing Cyber Threats Network security protects sensitive data, such as personal data, intellectual property, customer details, financial records, and more, from cyber threats like malware, ransomware, and phishing. 2. Ensuring Business Continuity & System Resilience Robust network security minimizes downtime and ensures the business remains operational and resilient against cyberattacks. 3. Regulatory Compliance & Risk Management Effective network security ensures that organizations remain compliant with regulatory frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This reduces the risk of legal fines and penalties. 4. Strengthening Access Control & Authentication Network security strengthens access control and authentication, ensuring only authorized employees can access sensitive data and minimizing the risk of insider threats. 5. Enhancing Customer Trust & Brand Reputation Commitment to protecting sensitive organizational and client data can enhance a business’s reputation and build trust with partners. What Are the Challenges in Network Security? The top challenges in network security are: 1. Expanding Attack Surface & Advanced Cyber Threats The rise in new technology and platforms has expanded the attack surface, providing hackers with multiple points to access an organization’s network. In the context of cyber warfare , these expanded vulnerabilities can be exploited by nation-state actors to target critical infrastructure and disrupt essential services. 2. BYOD & Remote Work Risks While bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies and remote work have blurred traditional location and network boundaries, they have also introduced new vulnerabilities. For instance, employees’ devices may lack robust network security controls, which can expose data over unsecured networks. 3. Cloud Security & Misconfigurations The complexity of modern networks, especially with the growing use of cloud environments, and human errors can result in misconfigurations, leading to security gaps and cyber attacks. 4. Managing Privileged Access & Insider Threats Uncontrolled admin access can increase the risk of insider threats and data breaches. Therefore, organizations must monitor user activity and manage privileged access to prevent misuse. Network Security Solutions & Services for Enterprises Network security in inherently more complex in larger, more complicated IT environments. Fortunately, there are several solutions fit for network protection at scale: Enterprise Security Solutions & Threat Detection Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Modern security operations centers (SOC) require a centralized approach to event management. Without it, they lack the context or visibility to protect the organization effectively. SIEM solutions provide a unified view of security across the enterprise, collecting information from network, endpoint, cloud, and other security products. They also offer behavior-based AI-powered threat detection, investigation, compliance reporting, and more. In short, SIEM reduces the complexity of managing network and security operations. Network Detection and Response (NDR) NDR monitors internal network traffic, baselining normal behaviors and using machine learning (ML) and other analytics to detect malware, malicious traffic, and abnormal patterns that may indicate an attacker within the network. It also provides a robust capability to investigate and take immediate action on verified alerts. Extended Detection and Response (XDR) XDR streamlines threat detection and response across an enterprise's security ecosystem. By consolidating data from endpoints, networks, emails, and the cloud, it identifies and links suspicious activities that individual tools might miss. This integrated approach enables quick investigation and remediation of alerts or multi-step incidents through automated and manual actions. Leveraging endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities, XDR provides endpoint agents, telemetry, and endpoint blocking to effectively manage challenges while enhancing threat detection and response capabilities. Managed Security Services for Threat Defense The progression from endpoint detection and response ( EDR ) to managed detection and response (MDR) to extended detection and response (XDR) follows the path of digital acceleration with ever-expanding attack surfaces and a hybrid workforce. Essentially, the difference between EDR, MDR, and XDR are as follows: EDR : Endpoint Detection and Response acts like an alarm system for an organization. When it detects a threat at an endpoint, it immediately alerts the company. MDR: Managed Detection and Response is a security approach that focuses on individuals and their behaviors. It prioritizes endpoint protection. XDR : Extended Detection and Response takes MDR to the next level with a software-based practice that protects an enterprise's entire infrastructure. Today, network edges are anywhere the user connects and businesses may not be able to extend security everywhere it’s needed. Managed security service providers (MSSPs) can help fill the gap with the critical expertise and infrastructure required immediately, at less cost. For example, a managed detection and response (MDR) service can be a great choice for SMBs that need enterprise-grade threat monitoring and response but find it too expensive to build or staff internally. Larger organizations who need more comprehensive protection of a distributed environment and don’t have the resources in house, can choose an XDR service for cross-layered detection and response. XDR collects, normalizes, and then correlates data over a variety of security layers, including endpoints, firewalls, email, servers, cloud workloads, and the general network. 1 - MDR + XDR MDR is a fully managed threat detection and response service delivered by an outsourced MSSP. With MDR services, security teams can enhance their ability to rapidly detect, investigate, and respond to unauthorized and/or suspicious activity. Some MDR services also offer threat hunting and recommendations for improving overall security posture. Some MSSPs also extend MDR with XDR which monitors, detects and analyzes security signals across endpoints, network, cloud, SIEM and email security systems. XDR is a new, alternative approach to traditional detection and incident response , integrating detection and response procedures across multiple environments to reduce the mean time to detect and repair attacks. XDR is a natural extension of EDR suitable for organizations that have complex IT environments or are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. XDR is highly scalable, supports multiple data sources, and ensures end-to-end protection of an organization’s attack surfaces. 2 - Managed SOC-as-a-Service (SOCaaS) A typical in-house security operations center (SOC) requires a dedicated staff of security engineers and analysts and the tools to support their work. The high cost of running a SOC in house compounded by the shortage of cybersecurity talent and the burnout that often transpires, leads many organizations to choose a managed SOC-as-a-Service (SOCaaS). This allows them to outsource threat hunting, monitoring, detection, and remediation to an MDR or MXDR service provider with the cybersecurity experience,  infrastructure, and tools, to actively monitor customers’ threat surfaces 24/7. 3 - Managed Firewall Service Cloud security is a shared responsibility. In general, the public cloud infrastructure is secured by the service provider—such as AWS, Azure, or GCP—and the workloads running on the infrastructure are secured by the customer. To meet the business imperative of cloud migration, organizations need a network security solution in the cloud that offers advanced protection, flexibility, and predictable costs. However, organizations that are accelerating their cloud adoption may not have the resources, skills , or time to build, scale, or adapt their cloud security to meet the pace of their business. A managed firewall service allows organizations to offload cloud security infrastructure maintenance, get deep visibility, apply robust controls, and optimize cloud security spend. A cloud-native, managed firewall service removes the heavy lifting around network security operations and provides a frictionless experience to help customers easily deploy enterprise-grade security on the public cloud. Cloud migration requires organizations to secure key cloud services. A next-generation, managed firewall service or network Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS)  simplifies security management with full visibility across environments and broad protection across cloud workloads and applications. Whether a managed firewall service or a network FWaaS, it is critical that organizations ensure that their public cloud workloads are protected by next-generation security solutions powered by comprehensive threat intelligence. AI-Driven Threat Intelligence With bad actors increasingly using Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and other AI technologies to create new, more compelling exploits and threats faster than ever, security teams must also leverage AI technologies to fight fire with fire. AI-powered threat intelligence is arguably the most important use case, as it can help organizations remain in lockstep with emerging threats. That’s why cybersecurity vendors, including Fortinet, are escalating their AI capabilities. To stay ahead of the curve, IT leaders should ask their providers how they’re applying AI, what technologies their AI tools use, and most importantly, how their applications contribute to one or more of the benefits below: Next-Gen Network Security Trends Workload Security Cloud workload security signifies the security of data, applications, and all the infrastructure in cloud environments. It is a leading trend in next-gen network security because of the increasing usage of cloud applications. Organizations are transitioning to the cloud and prioritizing visibility, risk mitigation, and integration with DevOps to ensure secure distributed workloads across containers, virtual machines, and serverless environments. Cloud workload security helps them achieve the goal by providing real-time threat detection and continuous network security without impacting performance. Mobile Device Security Mobile devices have become a vital part of everyday work, and therefore, organizations are focusing on security trends like building mobile security policies. The goal is to create a secure work environment, even when employees access data through mobile devices. Organizations are offering employee training and leveraging mobile device management tools to monitor and secure devices. Moreover, they are creating and teaching employees the best practices for protecting sensitive data and reducing risks associated with mobile device use. AI and Emerging Trends in Network Security Hybrid mesh firewalls Hybrid IT network environments include multiple threat surfaces by combining on-premises equipment at corporate sites, cloud environments, and remote access by work-from-anywhere users—all of which add complexity to network security management. To solve this problem, a hybrid mesh firewall addresses network security with a unified security platform that provides coordinated protection across multiple areas of enterprise IT, to secure corporate sites such as branches, campuses, and data centers; public and private clouds; and remote access points. To do this, hybrid mesh firewalls come in various form factors, including appliances, virtual machines, cloud-native firewalls, and Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS). Secure SD-WAN SD-WAN provides secure, reliable connectivity between branch and remote locations. Secure SD-WAN extends that protection to cloud-first, security-sensitive,  global enterprises, and their hybrid workforces. Using one operating system, Secure SD-WAN consolidates functions across SD-WAN, next-generation firewall (NGFW), advanced routing, and ZTNA application gateway to simplify management and secure networking while enabling organizations to implement a robust SD-WAN security architecture for comprehensive protection. Secure SD-WAN is the foundation for a seamless transition to SASE and SD-Branch. It enables organizations to protect their investment and simplify operations along their journey to a Zero Trust Architecture . Unified SASE A Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture converges networking and several cloud-delivered Secure Service Edge solutions to protect distributed networks with advanced cybersecurity at every endpoint/edge.  SD-WAN is the networking component and FWaaS, SWG , CASB, and ZTNA comprise the edge security of SASE.  The advantage of a SASE architecture is that it provides users with secure connections without the latency that results from backlogging traffic all the way to the central data center. A Unified SASE solution seamlessly integrates essential networking and security technologies delivered via the cloud. It ensures secure access for hybrid workers and safeguards applications and data on any cloud. A single operating system unifies the SASE components enabling seamless and complete convergence of networking and security. Unifed SASE secures access to the internet, corporate resources, and SaaS applications no matter the users or resources locations. Universal ZTNA According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (of both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device (BYOD) , IoT, and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. ZTNA is a capability that controls access to applications. It extends the principles of ZTA to verify users and devices before every application session. ZTNA confirms that they meet the organization’s policy before they can access that application. However, ZTNA may work differently, depending on where a user is located, meaning that access to applications or networks may work from one location but fail from another. In contrast, Universal ZTNA enables secure connections regardless of the location of the network or user. Users can work from anywhere, and administrators can apply zero-trust principles without having to worry about the quality of network connections. Universal ZTNA improves security and connectivity regardless of where users are located—on-premise or remote, or the type of network architecture.

Top 8 Best Practices for Network Security Here are the top eight best practices for network security 1. Conduct Regular Security Audits Regular security audits help organizations identify and detect vulnerabilities before they escalate, keeping network infrastructure secure. 2. Implement Network Segmentation Dividing the network into small, multiple segments enables granular control over data flow and access. This reduces the attack surface and contains potential damage within isolated segments. 3. Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Strong Passwords Implementing MFA, which adds an extra verification step before granting access, combined with strong passwords, can reduce unauthorized access and strengthen network security. 4. Use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for Secure Remote Access VPNs encrypt traffic between remote users and the network, establishing secure connections and safeguarding sensitive data over the internet. 5. Establish a Zero-Trust Security Framework The zero-trust security framework works on the principle of “never trust, always verify,” assuming no device is secure. It verifies each device in the network before granting access, thus minimizing the chances of breaches. 6. Enforce Least Privilege Access A least privilege access policy limits users’ access and provides only the minimum level of access required to perform a job. This minimizes the attack surface, safeguarding sensitive data. 7. Secure Wireless Networks Implement strong encryption protocols and strict authentication policies, and continuously monitor the wireless network. 8. Train Employees on Network Security Awareness According to the Fortinet 2023 Cloud Security Report , 43% of companies state that talent shortage is their biggest challenge in securing cloud workloads. So, it’s crucial to educate the employees about what is network security, how to identify cyberattacks like phishing and social engineering, and steps to take after an incident. Advancing Your Approach to Network Security Network security defines an organization’s readiness to combat ever-evolving cyber threats and its seriousness to safeguard the integrity of its data and that of its customers from unauthorized access. The basic password encryption approach is no longer relevant and cannot prevent threats. Statista reveals that data breaches are among the top concerns of company leaders. Around 422.61 million data records were compromised in the third quarter of 2024. Such incidents can damage a company’s reputation and lead to the loss of customer trust in the long term. Therefore, implementing strong and advanced network security measures and tools is crucial to preventing these breaches and safeguarding sensitive data.

Network security is the protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. It involves creating a secure infrastructure for devices, applications, users, and applications to work in a secure manner. Why Network Security is Important (04:13) Cisco Secure Firewall How does network security work? Network security combines multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. Each network security layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network resources, but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats. How do I benefit from network security? Digitization has transformed our world. How we live, work, play, and learn have all changed. Every organization that wants to deliver the services that customers and employees demand must protect its network. Network security also helps you protect proprietary information from attack. Ultimately it protects your reputation. Types of network security Firewalls A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. Cisco offers both threat-focused firewalls and unified threat management (UTM) devices. Explore Cisco Secure Firewall Workload security Workload security protects workloads moving across different cloud and hybrid environments. These distributed workloads have larger attack surfaces, which must be secured without affecting the agility of the business. Explore Cisco Secure Workload NetWORK security NetWORK security is Cisco's vision for simplifying network, workload, and multicloud security by delivering unified security controls to dynamic environments. Explore our NetWORK vision Network segmentation Software-defined segmentation puts network traffic into different classifications and makes enforcing security policies easier. Ideally, the classifications are based on endpoint identity, not mere IP addresses. You can assign access rights based on role, location, and more so that the right level of access is given to the right people and suspicious devices are contained and remediated. Learn about network segmentation VPN A virtual private network encrypts the connection from an endpoint to a network, often over the internet. Typically, a remote-access VPN uses IPsec or Secure Sockets Layer to authenticate the communication between device and network. Explore VPN Access control Not every user should have access to your network. To keep out potential attackers, you need to recognize each user and each device. Then you can enforce your security policies. You can block noncompliant endpoint devices or give them only limited access. This process is network access control (NAC). Cisco Identity Services Engine Anti-virus and anti-malware software ""Malware,"" short for ""malicious software,"" includes viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. Sometimes malware will infect a network but lie dormant for days or even weeks. The best antimalware programs not only scan for malware upon entry, but also continuously track files afterward to find anomalies, remove malware, and fix damage. Learn about Cisco Secure Endpoint Application security Any software you use to run your business needs to be protected, whether your IT staff builds it or whether you buy it. Unfortunately, any application may contain holes, or vulnerabilities, that attackers can use to infiltrate your network. Application security encompasses the hardware, software, and processes you use to close those holes. Full-stack Observability AppDynamics APM Cisco application-first products Security Advisory Services Behavioral analytics To detect abnormal network behavior, you must know what normal behavior looks like. Behavioral analytics tools automatically discern activities that deviate from the norm. Your security team can then better identify indicators of compromise that pose a potential problem and quickly remediate threats. Cisco Secure Network Analytics Built-in security analytics across Cisco Cloud security Cloud security is a broad set of technologies, policies, and applications applied to defend online IP, services, applications, and other imperative data. It helps you better manage your security by shielding users against threats anywhere they access the internet and securing your data and applications in the cloud. Explore cloud security solutions Data loss prevention Organizations must make sure that their staff does not send sensitive information outside the network. Data loss prevention, or DLP, technologies can stop people from uploading, forwarding, or even printing critical information in an unsafe manner. Learn about data loss prevention Email security Email gateways are the number one threat vector for a security breach. Attackers use personal information and social engineering tactics to build sophisticated phishing campaigns to deceive recipients and send them to sites serving up malware. An email security application blocks incoming attacks and controls outbound messages to prevent the loss of sensitive data. Industrial network security As you are digitizing your industrial operations, the deeper integration between IT, cloud, and industrial networks is exposing your Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to cyberthreats. You need full visibility into your OT security posture to segment the industrial network, and feed IT security tools with rich details on OT devices and behaviors. Explore Cisco industrial/OT security Learn about Cisco Cyber Vision Mobile device security Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting mobile devices and apps. Within the next three years, 90 percent of IT organizations may support corporate applications on personal mobile devices. Of course, you need to control which devices can access your network. You will also need to configure their connections to keep network traffic private. Learn about Cisco Meraki Security information and event management SIEM products pull together the information that your security staff needs to identify and respond to threats. These products come in various forms, including physical and virtual appliances and server software. Identity Services Engine with SIEM Web security A web security solution will control your staff's web use, block web-based threats, and deny access to malicious websites. It will protect your web gateway on site or in the cloud. ""Web security"" also refers to the steps you take to protect your own website. Cisco Secure Web Appliance Wireless security Wireless networks are not as secure as wired ones. Without stringent security measures, installing a wireless LAN can be like putting Ethernet ports everywhere, including the parking lot. To prevent an exploit from taking hold, you need products specifically designed to protect a wireless network.

Select chevron_right Network Security vs. Endpoint Security Access Control Network Segmentation Perimeter Security Encryption Network security basics are the critical elements of network or cyber security. They should be implemented within all networks including home, business, and internet. Effective network security requires protection of wired and wireless networks with firewalls, anti-malware software, intrusion detection systems, access control, and more. Network security basics Network security is a complex topic that involves many different technologies with configurations that are sometimes complicated. The security issue to address is the separation between what is on the network and the endpoints or host systems that are attached to it. The technology for both the network and the endpoints includes access control and encryption, but on the network, there is also segmentation and perimeter security. Network security vs. endpoint security Network security is only part of the security equation, and it is usually considered to apply to the devices that protect the network itself. A firewall can be a standalone device that sits beside networking equipment such as routers or switches, or software within the same physical box that also routes and/or switches. On the network there are firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), virtual private network (VPN) appliances, data leak prevention (DLP) systems, etc. The network exists to connect systems to each other. It is what enables you to browse Amazon or shop online at your local grocery store. But end systems must also be protected; that is called endpoint security. These devices include laptops, tablets, phones, but also the internet of things (IoT) devices. IoT includes devices such as connected thermostats, cameras, refrigerators, front door locks, light bulbs, pool pumps, smart duvets, etc. These devices require security controls as well, but not all devices are sophisticated enough to contain something like a host-based firewall or anti-malware agent. If the endpoint is a light bulb, then it probably relies on network security for its protection. Access control The first place to start is with access control. Businesses commonly referred to this as identity and access management (IAM). Controlling access is not new. Humans have controlled access to buildings since the first lock was installed on a door over six thousand years ago. Access control is now performed on networks, computers, phones, applications, websites, and files. Fundamentally, access control is broken down into IAAA: Identification is the assertion of a user's name or identification such as a User ID or email address. Authentication provides proof that the user is who they claim to be. This is still most commonly done with passwords. Authorization is granting permissions to the user, or not. It could be that the user is not authorized and therefore has no permissions, or the user could be granted permissions for read, write, full control, etc. Accountability is tracking what happened. The log shows that a user attempted access or gained access. The log could also include all the actions the user takes. Authentication types Within IAAA, authentication might be the most important topic today. Passwords are still the most common authentication on most systems. They are typically not very secure, however, because they are easy to crack. If a password is short enough, the hacker has little trouble figuring out what it is. Hackers use a password-guessing attack that entails brute force – trying all possible combinations. Or the attacker could use a password-cracking attack, which entails using a program to recreate passwords that hash to the same value. There are three authentication types or factors in use today. They are: Something you know – a string of characters, numbers or a combination of those that are stored in your brain. Today they should be stored in a password manager. Something you have – a device or a piece of software on a device you need to have to authenticate. This includes devices such as an RSA token or the Google authenticator on a smart phone. Something you are – an aspect of your person. This is biometrics, either physiological like a fingerprint, or behavioral like a voice print. The best choice is two-factor authentication (2FA), sometimes referred to as multi-factor authentication (MFA). We highly recommended it for your personal accounts such as Amazon or Facebook. Applications such as the Google authenticator are free to use and a much better choice than receiving a text or short message service (SMS) message to your phone. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends against SMS. We also recommend 2FA for the office, but it is a decision at a policy or management level to require this or not. It depends on many factors such as the asset, its data classification, the risks, and the vulnerabilities. Network segmentation Network segmentation improves security by controlling the flow of data between different networks. This is most commonly accomplished with virtual local area networks (VLANs). There are many variations on this theme, such as private virtual LAN (PVLAN), virtual extensible LAN (VXLAN), and so on. A VLAN exists at the data link layer – layer 2 of the open system interconnect (OSI) model. Most network administrators map an internet protocol (IP) subnet to a VLAN. Routers enable traffic to pass between VLANS according to the configuration. If you want control, router configuration is critical. Another option found within the cloud is called a virtual private cloud (VPC). Traffic control to and from the VPC is also controlled by configurations. Understanding the business requirements for the workload is essential to configure and control access to or from VLANs and VPCs. Perimeter security Perimeter security is based on the logic that there is a defined edge between an internal/trusted network and an external/untrusted network. This is traditional network design that dates to when the network and data center were confined within a single building. In this configuration, a router connects the internal and external networks. Basic configuration of an access control list (ACL) within the router controls the traffic that can pass through. You can add security at the perimeter with firewalls, IDS, and IPS.  For more information on these, see the Network Security Measures page. Encryption Encryption is essential to keep sensitive data and communications away from prying eyes. Encryption protects files on your computer’s hard drive, a banking session, data stored in the cloud, sensitive emails, and a long list of other applications. Cryptography also provides verification of data integrity and authentication of the data’s source. Encryption falls into two basic types of cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric cryptography has a single key that encrypts and decrypts. As a result, it must be shared with someone else to complete the encrypted communication. Common algorithms include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Blowfish, Triple-DES (Data Encryption Standard), and many more. Asymmetric cryptography has two distinct keys, one public and one private, that work as a matched set. The set of keys belongs to one user or one service: for example, a web server. One key is for encryption and the other is for decryption. If the public key encrypts the data, it keeps the data confidential. This is because the owner of the private key is the only one who can decrypt it. If the private key encrypts the data, it proves the authenticity of the source. When the data is successfully decrypted with the public key, it means that only the private key could have encrypted it. The public key is truly public, accessible to anyone. A third topic is hashing. Even though it is not encryption, it needs to be included at this point in security discussions. Hashing runs an algorithm against a message that calculates a resultant answer, called the hash, that is based on the bits of that message. Bits can be data, voice, or video. Hashing does not change the value of the data in any way. In contrast, encryption alters the data to an unreadable state. Hashing proves that the bits of the message have not changed. It ensures the data has integrity and that it is in its original format. Only hashing protects data from accidental changes. If the hash is encrypted with an asymmetric private key, it proves that a hacker has not maliciously tampered with the data. Malicious changes cannot occur unless the private key is compromised. If the key has not been compromised, then you know that the person who has the private key must be the person who calculated the hash. That key could be a symmetric key, which is sometimes referred to as a private key, or the asymmetric private key. Wireless security It is difficult to protect data, voice or video transmitted over a wireless network. Wireless transmissions are intended to emit a signal, and this makes it easier for a hacker within range to capture the transmission. There are encryption standards for wireless, but most have been broken in one way or another. Encryption standards include WEP, WPA, WPA2, and now WPA3. Wired equivalent privacy (WEP) uses the RC4 symmetric algorithm to encrypt the wireless transmission. Hackers quickly broke it and there is now a handy hacking tool called WEP crack for that purpose. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) replaced WEP but still used RC4. Hackers modified WEP crack to break WPA. WPA2, the second version of WPA, has two options. WPA2-personal uses a pre-shared key, sometime called a security key. It is essentially a password that is typed into a wireless device such as a laptop or phone, and into the wireless access point (WAP). Hackers found the first flaw in 2017, called a K ey R einstallation A tta CK (KRACK). WPA2-enterprise uses an additional layer of security by authenticating the user at a centralized remote authentication dial-in user service (RADIUS) server. It also uses the extensible authentication protocol (EAP) to pass the authentication information on the local wireless connection. The combination of RADIUS and EAP as a security protocol is called IEEE 802.1x. Source: https://www.securew2.com/solutions/802-1x/ WPA3 also has two options. WPA3-personal gives users a higher level of protection using a 128-bit encryption key. This provides robust password authentication, even when user passwords are too simplistic for safety. WPA3-personal achieves this using simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) instead of the pre-shared key in WPA2-personal. WPA3-enterprise[SM2] [TA(3] [SM4]  uses a 192-bit encryption key for greater security. It is an enhancement of WPA2 that applies security protocols consistently throughout an organization’s network. Security certifications Network security is complex. It is an unending battle of wits against the hackers. See the Network Security Measures page for more information. It is always a great idea to pursue security certifications. Either the CompTIA Security+ certification or the System Security Certified Practitioner ( (ISC) 2® SSCP ) certification is a great starting point. A more advanced manager-level certification, with a bit of technical knowledge thrown in, is the Certified Information System Security Professional ( (ISC) 2® CISSP ) certification. You can also take vendor-specific exams such as the cloud-based exams for AWS , GCP , or Azure .

Every day, businesses, government agencies, and individuals are exposed to a range of cyber threats, from data breaches to malicious attacks that can cripple entire systems. At its core, network security involves protecting both the hardware and software technologies used within a computer network, with the goal of safeguarding data, devices, and systems from unauthorized access and malicious activities. In a world where connectivity is constantly increasing, securing a network has never been more important. The fundamentals of network security include practices like using firewalls to filter traffic, implementing encryption to protect sensitive data, and ensuring that systems are protected by strong intrusion detection systems (IDS). By understanding these foundational principles and keeping them updated, businesses and individuals can greatly reduce the risk of cyberattacks that threaten to compromise their data, reputations, and overall safety in the digital space. What is Network Security ? Network security refers to the policies, procedures, and technologies used to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of computer networks and their resources. The main goal of network security is to safeguard data, devices, and users from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, data breaches, and other security threats. Why is Network Security Important? Protects Sensitive Information: Personal, financial, and business data are at risk of being intercepted, stolen, or altered. Prevents Unauthorized Access: Ensures that only authorized users can access critical network resources and data. Reduces the Risk of Cyberattacks: Safeguards against malware, ransomware, DDoS attacks, and phishing attempts. Regulatory Compliance: Helps businesses comply with data protection laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Maintains Business Continuity: By defending against network disruptions, security ensures that business operations remain uninterrupted. Key Concepts of Network Security To understand network security fully, it's essential to explore the core components and concepts that define it: 1. Confidentiality Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals can access specific data or information. Sensitive data like customer records, financial transactions, and personal information must be protected from unauthorized access. Methods: Encryption: Converting data into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access. Access Controls: Restricting access to sensitive data based on user roles and permissions. 2. Integrity Integrity ensures that data is accurate, reliable, and has not been tampered with during transmission. Any unauthorized alteration of data can compromise the trustworthiness of the information. Methods: Hashing: Creating a unique representation of data to detect any changes. Digital Signatures: Used to verify the authenticity of data and ensure it has not been altered. 3. Availability Availability ensures that network resources, data, and services are accessible and functional when needed. A denial of service or an attack that causes downtime can lead to severe disruptions. Methods: Redundancy: Having backup systems in place to maintain service during outages. Load Balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers to ensure availability during high demand. Common Types of Network Security Threats Malware: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems. This includes viruses, worms, ransomware, and trojans. Phishing: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information through deceptive emails, messages, or websites. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Attacks aimed at making a network service unavailable to users by overwhelming it with traffic. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Where attackers intercept and potentially alter the communication between two parties without their knowledge. SQL Injection: A form of attack where malicious SQL queries are inserted into an input field to manipulate the database. Insider Threats: Security risks posed by individuals within the organization who have authorized access but misuse it. Core Components of Network Security To protect computer networks, several technologies, protocols, and practices are employed. Let’s explore the most common and important components: 1. Firewalls A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks (such as the internet). Types: Packet Filtering Firewalls: Basic form of firewall that inspects packets and allows or blocks them based on predefined rules. Stateful Firewalls: Track the state of active connections and make decisions based on context. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW): Advanced firewalls that combine traditional firewall functionality with additional features like application awareness and intrusion prevention. 2. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) IDPS are designed to detect and respond to potential network security threats. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity, while an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) actively blocks detected threats. Key Features: Real-time monitoring Alerting system for suspicious activities Response mechanisms to block or mitigate attacks 3. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) A VPN is a secure network connection that allows users to send and receive data over public networks (like the internet) as if they were on a private network. It encrypts data, ensuring confidentiality and protection against eavesdropping. Use Cases: Remote access for employees working from different locations. Secure communication over unsecured networks, such as public Wi-Fi. 4. Network Access Control (NAC) NAC solutions ensure that only authorized devices can connect to the network. It enforces security policies by checking the health of a device before granting access to the network. Methods: Device authentication Endpoint security checks (e.g., antivirus status, software updates) 5. Encryption Encryption is a fundamental aspect of network security. It involves encoding data in such a way that only authorized parties can read it. Encryption protects data in transit and at rest, ensuring confidentiality. Common Encryption Methods: SSL/TLS: Protocols used to secure communications over the internet. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A widely used encryption algorithm for data protection. RSA Encryption: A public-key encryption method used for secure data transmission. Best Practices for Network Security Regular Software Updates: Ensure that all software, including operating systems, firewalls, and applications, are up to date with the latest security patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Strong Authentication mechanisms: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive systems. Data Backups: Regularly back up important data and configurations to minimize the impact of cyberattacks like ransomware or hardware failures. Network Segmentation: Divide the network into smaller, isolated segments to limit the spread of potential breaches. Employee Training: Educate employees on common cybersecurity threats such as phishing and social engineering. Human error is often the weakest link in cybersecurity. Case Study Case Study 1: Sony – 2014 Sony Pictures Cyberattack Overview: Sony Pictures Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony, is one of the largest entertainment companies globally. Challenge: In November 2014, Sony Pictures was hit by a massive cyberattack , attributed to the North Korean hacking group Guardians of Peace (GOP). The attack resulted in the theft of sensitive data, including emails, intellectual property , and unreleased movies , leading to severe operational disruption and reputational damage. How It Worked: Spear-phishing emails with malware were sent to employees. The malware gave attackers remote access to Sony's network. They exfiltrated data and deployed wiper malware that destroyed internal files and systems. Outcome: Massive Data Breach: Confidential emails and unreleased films were leaked, causing financial and reputational damage. Increased Security: Sony invested in stronger intrusion detection systems (IDS), firewalls, and employee training to prevent phishing. Legal Fallout: The company faced lawsuits and had to rebuild its public image. Case Study 2: Microsoft – 2020 Exchange Server Hack Overview: Microsoft is a global technology leader, providing services like Microsoft Exchange, widely used for email management. Challenge: In March 2021, a cyberattack exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server. The Hafnium hacking group gained unauthorized access to email accounts and deployed malware. How It Worked: Attackers exploited four zero-day vulnerabilities to access email accounts. They used web shells for persistent access to affected servers. Stolen data included emails, contacts, and attachments. Outcome: Global Impact: The attack affected thousands of organizations worldwide, including businesses and government agencies. Quick Response: Microsoft released security patches and advised customers to change passwords and secure networks. Increased Focus on Security: Microsoft emphasized patch management and the importance of timely updates. Network security is the backbone of any organization’s cybersecurity strategy.

These sites may look harmless, but the emails delivering them still rely on a familiar formula. Urgent language. Faked sender details. Links like these are designed to pass through security filters, and many do. That’s why protection against phishing attacks in 2025 takes more than awareness training. Spotting red flags helps, but it’s not enough. You need to understand how phishing works now, how the tactics have changed, and why traditional defenses often miss them. Email is still the most straightforward way in. These attacks can lead to wire fraud, credential theft, malware infections, or full-scale business email compromise. In this guide, we’ll break down how phishing attacks in emails work, the most common types targeting businesses, and the steps you can take to protect your users and your data. Subscribe to our Behind the Shield Newsletter. What Is Email Phishing & How Does This Scam Work? Phishing attacks now account for over 22% of all cybercrime. In 2025, they're not just common, they're constant. The FBI received 193,407 phishing-related complaints last year alone. It’s important to demystify phishing attacks to better understand how they work. Phishing emails impersonate people you trust — vendors, coworkers, even your own boss — to get you to act before thinking. Maybe hand over a password, open a file you weren’t expecting, or send money to the wrong place. Most phishing campaigns are after sensitive information: financial details, login credentials, and company data. Some attackers still send generic spam to thousands of people, but more are shifting to targeted emails that feel personal and credible. Today’s phishing attacks often use social engineering, and in many cases, AI. Messages are timed well, written clearly, and crafted to sound familiar. They don’t feel like scams. They feel like routine communication. That’s the trap. It works because it’s cheap, fast, and hard to trace for attackers; launching a campaign costs next to nothing. For the targets, the damage can be lasting, including stolen data, compromised systems, weeks of downtime, and real reputational harm. Common Phishing Attack Types in 2025 (With Real Examples) Since 1987, phishing attacks have evolved into a set of highly targeted, professional-grade scams built to steal valuable data. Some of the most pervasive modern types of phishing attacks include: Standard Email Phishing : Arguably the most notorious form of phishing, this attack is an attempt to steal sensitive information via an email that appears to be from a legitimate, trusted source. Standard email phishing is not a targeted attack and is often conducted en masse. Spear Phishing: The truth is that the anatomy of a spear phishing attack is that they’re engineered. Attackers might pose as a trusted vendor, manager, or colleague and reference a recent project or request urgent action — “Can you review this invoice?” or “I need those login credentials now.” Even the tone and timing can feel eerily real. It’s not just a scam. It’s a simulation of trust. Malware Phishing: This attack utilizes the same techniques as typical email phishing; however, malware phishing attacks aim to trick targets into clicking a link or downloading an attachment so malware can be installed on their devices. With criminals leveraging AI-powered email generation and publicly available personal data, malware phishing is currently one of the most pervasive types of phishing attacks. Business Email Compromise (BEC) : Attackers gain access to a company email account, often an executive’s, and use it to impersonate them. The goal? Trick employees, partners, or customers into wiring money or handing over sensitive info. Clone Phishing: An attacker takes a real email you’ve already received and swaps the legit attachment or link with a malicious one. Then they send it to your contacts, posing as you. It looks familiar. That’s the trap. Man-In-The-Middle (MITM): An attacker gets in the way of traffic between you and a website and reads or adds data without you knowing. It doesn't need a false network; all it needs is public Wi-Fi that everyone can use. They are on the same connection as you and can watch what you do, steal your login information, or send you to a bogus site. Everything seems fine. That's the risk. How to Stop Phishing Emails in 2025: Tips & Best Practices Want to know how to stop phishing attacks in emails before they reach your users? It starts with sharpening awareness and reinforcing habits that recognize the signs before they’re too late. Visual Red Flags: What to Look For on the Surface Typos and strange grammar are still worth watching for. While many phishing emails look polished today, poorly written ones still make it through. If the language feels sloppy, slow down. Compare the subject to the message itself. If one sounds urgent and the other feels oddly vague or out of character, that mismatch could mean something’s off. Take a close look at the sender. Not the display name — the actual email address. A misspelled domain or extra character is a common trick. It’s easy to overlook in a rush. Behavioral Clues: Trust Your Instincts If something about the message feels wrong, don’t reply. Use a trusted contact method instead. Start a fresh thread or call them directly. That quick pause can stop an attack. Never open a file or click a link you weren’t expecting. It’s fine to double-check with the sender. If they’re legitimate, they won’t mind waiting. Context matters. Ask yourself: Was this message expected? Does it make sense right now? When in Doubt: Pause and Verify AI-written emails are getting harder to detect. If the tone feels a little too polished or just not quite like the sender, that discomfort is worth listening to. Watch for small inconsistencies. A subject about shipping, but the body talks about password resets? That’s a red flag. Don’t dismiss it. Spotting phishing is less about following a checklist and more about noticing when something doesn’t sit right. Familiar habits, slowing down, reading carefully, and checking sources, are your first line of defense. Practical Exercise The image below is a spear phishing email identified and quarantined by Guardian Digital EnGarde Cloud Email Security. It closely mimics a legitimate FedEx shipment confirmation email. Can you spot the phish? Some indications that this is a fraudulent email include the following: An invalid “From” email address Invalid tracking information, which differs in the subject and the body of the email A malicious attachment is located in the bottom left corner; FedEx does not send tracking information as an attachment. Still have Questions? What Is The Best Protection Against Phishing Attacks? There is more than one way to protect yourself from phishing attacks. You need to be aware of your users and have a security stack that checks all the points. This includes scanning links and attachments in real time, catching attempts to impersonate others, checking senders (yes, SPF and DMARC are still important), and keeping up with new threats as they appear. How Can Businesses Improve Phishing Protection in 2025? To prevent phishing attacks and scams in 2025, businesses need to combine training that you can do with tools that can change as threats do. Think about more than just surface screens. Think about finding malware, protecting against spoofing, and scanning that happens in real time. And your defenses need to stay just as smart as phishing techniques get smarter, especially since AI can now make fake websites and messages that look and feel real. How Do Phishing Protection Tools Detect Malicious Emails? Sender behavior, message structure, and embedded link or attachment content are just a few of the indications that advanced phishing protection technologies look for. Heuristic scanning, sandbox analysis, URL reputation checks, and artificial intelligence are some of the methods they utilize to identify dangers that are typically missed by standard filters. These phishing protection tools work by analyzing multiple signals — not just content, but behavior, link structure, domain reputation, and spoofing indicators in real time. What Should I Do If I Clicked on a Phishing Link? Disconnect from the network, run a security scan, and alert your IT or security team immediately. Final Thougths: Why Protection Against Phishing Attacks Takes More Than Awareness Phishing attacks are so effective because they target the person, not the system. And while awareness is essential, protection against phishing attacks has to account for the moments when someone still clicks. Some phishing attacks in your inbox will still get through. A convincing message, a fake login page, a well-timed request. That’s all it takes. You need defenses built around the user. Real protection uses multiple controls working together. Not just one filter. Not just a warning banner. A strong email security platform can spot and block these threats as they happen. The good ones don’t wait for a signature update. They learn, adapt, and react in real time. Prevention starts with seeing phishing attacks as a part of a system, not just a message. It is crucial to prioritize team email security training ; strengthen your filters, and assume some attacks will get through. “Engaging in email security best practices is important, but this alone will not prevent a successful phishing attack,” says Guardian Digital CEO Dave Wreski. “A fully integrated email security solution that delivers total end-to-end control is critical to safeguard business email accounts.” The right system doesn’t just block spam. It catches the sophisticated threats. The quiet attacks. The zero-day lures. And it keeps evolving as the threats do. Like what you see?

Phishing, pronounced like “fishing,” is a method cybercriminals use to steal personal information. It’s a widespread form of identity theft that can be difficult to detect. Scammers often disguise their attempts as legitimate emails or websites, tricking individuals into sharing sensitive details. These include credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, login credentials, passwords, and phone numbers. To protect yourself, it’s crucial to approach unexpected emails and suspicious links cautiously and know how to respond if you accidentally engage in a phishing attempt . Why Phishing is a Growing Problem in 2024 Phishing attacks have become more sophisticated, making them one of the most effective tools for cybercriminals. Today’s phishing emails are often from trusted sources, like your bank or a well-known company. They can include professional logos, convincing email addresses, and even advanced HTML designs. This high level of professionalism can easily fool people into clicking on links that lead to fraudulent websites, where scammers steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. One of the reasons phishing is so successful is that cybercriminals have evolved their tactics. In 2024, phishing attacks have expanded to target email users, mobile devices, and other communication platforms. According to recent reports : 57% of organizations experience phishing attempts on a weekly or daily basis. An alarming 1.2% of emails are malicious, translating to around 3.4 billion daily phishing emails. Phishing attacks account for 36% of data breaches, and 83% of organizations fall victim to at least one phishing attack annually. Scammers also use advanced technologies, including AI, to craft highly personalized and convincing phishing messages. AI-generated phishing attempts can be difficult to spot because they mimic human language and behavior so well. This technological shift makes it more challenging than ever for individuals and organizations to detect and prevent attacks. In 2023, nearly 50% of professionals encountered Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks, with 35% of all cyberattacks resulting from BEC phishing . These sophisticated attacks aim to steal login credentials or financial information and have resulted in substantial financial losses: $17,700 is lost each minute due to phishing attacks. Large organizations, especially those with 10,000 or more employees, spend an average of $3.7 million annually dealing with phishing-related incidents. In 2024, phishing attacks have also become more diverse. Deceptive links remain the top strategy, accounting for 36% of phishing attempts, but attackers are now using multiple channels, including mobile apps and social media. Notably, the use of AI in phishing has created convincing fake login pages and emails that are nearly impossible to distinguish from the real thing. The sheer volume and sophistication of phishing attacks make it a serious threat to businesses and individuals alike. As attackers continue to innovate with new tools and tactics, vigilance and updated cybersecurity practices are critical to staying ahead of these ever-evolving threats. Types of Phishing Attacks Understanding different phishing attacks can help businesses protect sensitive information and save money. You can gain peace of mind by guarding against cybercrimes and implementing phishing protection. It’s especially valuable for business owners—allowing you to focus time, energy, and resources on growing your company instead of dealing with security breaches. Email Phishing Email remains a standard vehicle for phishing attacks . Cybercriminals send mass emails, hoping even a few recipients will fall for their scams. With 30% of phishing emails being opened, the scale can be staggering if emails are sent to thousands or millions of users. Spear Phishing Spear phishing is a form of targeted phishing that involves detailed research. Scammers gather information about a specific person’s contacts and customize a phishing email to make it appear as though it’s from a trusted colleague, friend, or family member. This personalization increases the likelihood of the victim sharing personally identifyable information or clicking on malicious links. Social Media Phishing Social media phishing occurs when scammers create fake profiles that mimic a user’s real friends. The attacker might send a new friend request, making it appear that the individual is starting over with a fresh account. This approach is designed to collect personal information or scam the victim’s contacts. Smishing (SMS Phishing) Smishing involves sending fraudulent messages via SMS or text messaging. These messages often contain malicious links or ask for personal information, pretending to be from legitimate organizations such as banks or service providers. Many users are unaware that phishing attempts can come through text, making this an increasingly common tactic. Vishing (Voice Phishing) Vishing uses phone calls to trick victims into revealing personal information or financial details. Scammers often impersonate trusted institutions, like banks or government agencies, using urgency or fear to manipulate their targets. The lack of visual cues over the phone can make it easier for criminals to deceive their victims. Whaling Whaling is a targeted phishing attack aimed at high-profile individuals, such as executives or government officials. The emails in whaling attacks are crafted to seem highly relevant and credible, often focusing on business or legal matters. The goal is to trick these high-value targets into transferring funds or disclosing sensitive information. Zishing (Zoom Phishing) Zishing, a relatively new form of phishing , targets users of video conferencing platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet. In a zishing attack, scammers send fake meeting invitations or links to join a video call. These links often mimic legitimate meeting platforms, tricking victims into entering their login credentials or downloading malware. Given the widespread adoption of virtual meetings, this method has become increasingly popular, as many users are less vigilant about verifying meeting invitations, especially during a busy workday. Falling for a zishing scam can lead to compromised accounts and leaked sensitive information shared in virtual meetings. Looking to Protect Your Business from Phishing Attacks?

[ 1 ] If standard tunnel setup and configuration messages are supported by all of the network hardware vendors, SD-WAN simplifies the management and operation of a WAN by decoupling the networking hardware from its control mechanism. This concept is similar to how software-defined networking implements virtualization technology to improve data center management and operation. [ 1 ] In practice, proprietary protocols are used to set up and manage an SD-WAN, meaning there is no decoupling of the hardware and its control mechanism. A key application of SD-WAN is to allow companies to build higher-performance WANs using lower-cost and commercially available Internet access , enabling businesses to partially or wholly replace more expensive private WAN connection technologies such as MPLS . [ 1 ] When SD-WAN traffic is carried over the Internet, there are no end-to-end performance guarantees. Carrier MPLS VPN WAN services are not carried as Internet traffic , but rather over carefully controlled carrier capacity, and do come with an end-to-end performance guarantee. [ citation needed ] History [ edit ] WANs were very important for the development of networking in general and for a long time one of the most important applications of networks both for military and enterprise applications. [ 2 ] The ability to communicate data over long distances was one of the main driving factors for the development of data communications, as it made it possible to overcome the distance limitations, as well as shortening the time necessary to exchange messages with other parties. Legacy WANs allowed communication over circuits connecting two or more endpoints. Earlier networking supported point-to-point communication over a slow speed circuit, usually between two fixed locations. As networking progressed, WAN circuits became faster and more flexible. Innovations like circuit and packet switching (in the form of X.25 , ATM and later Internet Protocol or Multiprotocol Label Switching ) allowed communication to become more dynamic, supporting ever-growing networks. [ 3 ] The need for strict control, security and quality of service (QOS) meant that multinational corporations were very conservative in leasing and operating their WANs. National regulations restricted the companies that could provide local service in each country, and complex arrangements were necessary to establish truly global networks. All that changed with the growth of the Internet , which permitted entities around the world to connect to each other. However, over the first years, the uncontrolled nature of the Internet was not considered adequate or safe for private corporate use. Independent of safety concerns, connectivity to the Internet became a necessity to the point where every branch required Internet access. At first, due to safety concerns, private communications were still done via WAN, and communication with other entities (including customers and partners) moved to the Internet. As the Internet grew in reach and maturity, companies started to evaluate how to leverage it for private corporate communications. During the early 2000s, application delivery over the WAN became an important topic of research and commercial innovation. [ 4 ] Over the next decade, increasing computing power made it possible to create software-based appliances that were able to analyze traffic and make informed decisions without delays, making it possible to create large-scale overlay networks over the public Internet that could replicate all the functionality of legacy WANs, at a fraction of the cost. SD-WAN combines several networking aspects to create full-fledged private networks, with the ability to dynamically share network bandwidth across the connection points. [ 1 ] Additional enhancements include central controllers, zero-touch provisioning , integrated analytics and on-demand circuit provisioning, with some network intelligence based in the cloud , allowing centralized policy management and security. [ 5 ] Networking publications started using the term SD-WAN to describe this new networking trend as early as 2014. [ 6 ] With the rapid shift to remote work as a result of lockdowns and stay at home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, SD-WAN grew in popularity as a way of connecting remote workers. [ 7 ] Overview [ edit ] WANs allow companies to extend their computer networks over large distances, connecting remote branch offices to data centers and to each other, and delivering applications and services required to perform business functions. Due to the physical constraints imposed by the propagation time over large distances, and the need to integrate multiple service providers to cover global geographies (often crossing nation boundaries), WANs face important operational challenges, including network congestion , packet delay variation , [ 8 ] packet loss , [ 9 ] and even service outages. Modern applications such as VoIP calling, videoconferencing , streaming media , and virtualized applications and desktops require low latency . [ 10 ] Bandwidth requirements are also increasing, especially for applications featuring high-definition video . [ 11 ] It can be expensive and difficult to expand WAN capability, with corresponding difficulties related to network management and troubleshooting. [ 1 ] SD-WAN products are designed to address these network problems. [ 6 ] By enhancing or even replacing traditional branch routers with virtualization appliances that can control application-level policies and offer a network overlay, less expensive consumer-grade Internet links can act more like a dedicated circuit. This simplifies the setup process for branch personnel. [ 12 ] SD-WAN products can be physical appliances or software based only. [ 13 ] Components [ edit ] The MEF Forum has defined an SD-WAN architecture consisting of an SD-WAN edge, SD-WAN gateway, SD-WAN controller and SD-WAN orchestrator. [ 5 ] SD-WAN edge [ edit ] The SD-WAN edge is a physical or virtual network function that is placed at an organization's branch/regional/central office site, data center, and in public or private cloud platforms. [ 5 ] MEF Forum has published the first SD-WAN service standard, MEF 70 [ 14 ] which defines the fundamental characteristics of an SD-WAN service plus service requirements and attributes. SD-WAN gateway [ edit ] SD-WAN gateways provide access to the SD-WAN service in order to shorten the distance to cloud-based services or the user, and reduce service interruptions. [ 15 ] A distributed network of gateways may be included in an SD-WAN service by the vendor or setup and maintained by the organization using the service. [ 15 ] By sitting outside the headquarters in the cloud, the gateway also reduces headquarters traffic. [ 15 ] SD-WAN orchestrator [ edit ] The SD-WAN orchestrator is a cloud hosted or on-premises web management tool that allows configuration, provisioning and other functions when operating an SD-WAN. It simplifies application traffic management by allowing central implementation of an organization's business policies. [ 16 ] SD-WAN controller [ edit ] The SD-WAN controller functionality, which can be placed in the orchestrator or in an SD-WAN gateway, is used to make forwarding decisions for application flows. [ 14 ] Application flows are IP packets that have been classified to determine their user application or grouping of applications to which they are associated. The grouping of application flows based on a common type, e.g., conferencing applications, is referred to as an Application Flow Group in MEF 70. Per MEF 70, the SD-WAN Edge classifies incoming IP packets at the SD-WAN UNI (SD-WAN user network interface), [ 14 ] determines, via OSI Layer 2 through Layer 7 classification, which application flow the IP packets belong to, and then applies the policies to block the application flow or allow the application flows to be forwarded based on the availability of a route to the destination SD-WAN UNI on a remote SD-WAN Edge. This helps ensure that application performance meets service level agreements (SLAs). [ 17 ] Required characteristics [ edit ] Тhe Gartner research firm has defined an SD-WAN as having four required characteristics: [ 1 ] The ability to support multiple connection types, such as MPLS , last mile fiber optic network or through high speed cellular networks e.g. 4G LTE and 5G wireless technologies The ability to do dynamic path selection, for load sharing and resiliency purposes A simple interface that is easy to configure and manage The ability to support VPNs , and third party services such as WAN optimization controllers, firewalls and web gateways Features [ edit ] Features of SD-WANs include resilience, quality of service (QoS), security, and performance, with flexible deployment options; simplified administration and troubleshooting; and online traffic engineering. Resilience [ edit ] A resilient SD-WAN reduces network downtime. To be resilient, the technology must feature real-time detection of outages and automatic switch over (fail over) to working links. [ 18 ] Quality of service [ edit ] SD-WAN technology supports quality of service by having application level awareness, giving bandwidth priority to the most critical applications. This may include dynamic path selection, sending an application on a faster link, or even splitting an application between two paths to improve performance by delivering it faster. [ 5 ] Security [ edit ] SD-WAN communication is usually secured using IPsec , a staple of WAN security. [ 19 ] Application optimization [ edit ] SD-WANs can improve application delivery using caching , storing recently accessed information in memory to speed future access. [ 20 ] Self-healing networks [ edit ] SD-WANs can incorporate artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) for continuous troubleshooting and fixes to network issues. [ 21 ] Deployment options [ edit ] Most SD-WAN products are available as pre-configured appliances, placed at the network edge in data centers, branch offices and other remote locations. There are also virtual appliances that can work on existing network hardware, or the appliance can be deployed as a virtual appliance on the cloud in environments such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Unified Communications as a service (UCaaS) or as Software as a Service (SaaS). [ 22 ] This allows enterprises to benefit from SD-WAN services as they migrate application delivery from corporate servers to cloud based services such as Salesforce.com and Google apps. [ 13 ] Administration and troubleshooting [ edit ] As with network equipment in general, GUIs may be preferred to command line interface (CLI) methods of configuration and control. [ 23 ] Other beneficial administrative features include automatic path selection, the ability to centrally configure each end appliance by pushing configuration changes out, and even a true software defined networking approach that lets all appliances and virtual appliances be configured centrally based on application needs rather than underlying hardware. [ 1 ] Online traffic engineering [ edit ] With a global view of network status, a controller that manages SD-WAN can perform careful and adaptive traffic engineering by assigning new transfer requests according to current usage of resources (links). For example, this can be achieved by performing central calculation of transmission rates at the controller and rate-limiting at the senders (end-points) according to such rates. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Secure access service edge (SASE) [ edit ] Main article: Secure access service edge SD-WAN is a core component of secure access service edge solutions (SASE) which incorporate network and security capabilities to more efficiently and securely connect distributed work environments (branch office, headquarters, home office, remote) to distributed applications located in data centers, cloud infrastructure, or delivered by SaaS services. With SASE, SD-WAN is combined with other network and security technologies including cloud access security broker (CASB), Secure Web Gateway , Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Zero Trust Network Access ( ZTNA ), Firewall, and other capabilities to connect and protect users and applications. In December 2021, Gartner research firm estimated that by 2025, 50% of SD-WAN purchases will be part of a single vendor SASE offering. [ 29 ] Complementary technology [ edit ] SD-WAN versus WAN optimization [ edit ] There are some similarities between SD-WAN and WAN optimization , the name given to the collection of techniques used to increase data-transfer efficiencies across WANs. The goal of each is to accelerate application delivery between branch offices and data centers, but SD-WAN technology focuses additionally on cost savings and efficiency, specifically by allowing lower cost network links to perform the work of more expensive leased lines, whereas WAN Optimization focuses squarely on improving packet delivery. An SD-WAN utilizing virtualization techniques assisted with WAN Optimization traffic control allows network bandwidth to dynamically grow or shrink as needed. SD-WAN technology and WAN optimization can be used separately or together, [ 30 ] and some SD-WAN vendors are adding WAN optimization features to their products. [ 20 ] [ 31 ] WAN edge routers [ edit ] A WAN edge router is a device that routes data packets between different WAN locations, giving enterprise access to a carrier network. Also called a boundary router, it is unlike a core router, which only sends packets within a single network. [ 32 ] SD-WANs can work as an overlay to simplify the management of existing WAN edge routers, by lowering dependence on routing protocols. [ 6 ] SD-WAN can also potentially be an alternative to WAN Edge routers. [ 12 ] SD-WAN versus hybrid WAN [ edit ] SD-WANs are similar to hybrid WANs, and sometimes the terms are used interchangeably, but they are not identical. A hybrid WAN consists of different connection types, and may have a software defined network (SDN) component, but doesn't have to. [ 33 ] SD-WAN versus MPLS [ edit ] Cloud-based SD-WAN offers advanced features, such as enhanced security, seamless cloud, and support for mobile users, that result naturally from the use of cloud infrastructure. As a result, cloud-based SD-WAN can replace MPLS, enabling organizations to release resources once tied to WAN investments and create new capabilities. [ 34 ] An overview discussing three typical reasons to compare MPLS with SD-WAN. Specifically where IT teams need to retain MPLS due to contract commitments and where the Enterprise migrates from MPLS to an Internet-based SD WAN. [ 35 ] Testing and validation [ edit ] As there is no standard algorithm for SD-WAN controllers, device manufacturers each use their own proprietary algorithm in the transmission of data. These algorithms determine which traffic to direct over which link and when to switch traffic from one link to another. Given the breadth of options available in relation to both software and hardware SD-WAN control solutions, it's imperative they be tested and validated under real-world conditions within a lab setting prior to deployment. [ citation needed ] There are multiple solutions available for testing purposes, ranging from purpose-built network emulation appliances which can apply specified network impairments to the network being tested in order to reliably validate performance, to software-based solutions. [ citation needed ] Marketplace [ edit ] Network World IT website divides the SD-WAN vendor market into three groups: established networking vendors who are adding SD-WAN products to their offerings, WAN specialists who are starting to integrate SD-WAN functionality into their products, and startups focused specifically on the SD-WAN market. [ 1 ] The global SD-WAN market stood at $3.25 billion in 2021 and the market is expected to grow 30% in 2022. According to SD-WAN market Report Datavagyanik, North America accounted for more than 77% of the market. [ 36 ] Alternatively, a market overview by Nemertes Research groups SD-WAN vendors into categories based on their original technology space, and which are ""Pure-play SD-WAN providers"", ""WAN optimization vendors"", ""Link-aggregation vendors"", and ""General network vendors"". [ 30 ] While Network World's second category (startups focused specifically on the SD-WAN market), is generally equivalent to Nemertes' ""Pure-play SD-WAN providers"" category, Nemertes offers a more detailed view of the preexisting WAN and overall networking providers. [ citation needed ] Additionally, Nemertes Research also describes the in-net side of the SD-WAN market, describing the go-to-market strategy of connectivity providers entering the SD-WAN market. These providers include ""Network-as-a-service vendors"", ""Carriers or telcos"", ""Content delivery networks"" and ""Secure WAN providers"". [ citation needed ] Open source [ edit ] MEF 70 standardizes SD-WAN service attributes and uses standard IPv4 and IPv6 routing protocols. SD-WAN services also use standard IPsec encryption protocols. Additional standardization for other SD-WAN functions and related security functionality not covered in MEF 70 are under development at the MEF Forum. There are several opensource SD-WAN solutions and opensource SD-WAN implementations available. For example, the Linux Foundation has three projects that intersect with and help the SD-WAN market: ONAP , OpenDaylight Project , and the Tungsten Fabric (formerly Juniper Networks ' OpenContrail).

Software-Defined WAN (SDWAN) Explore Cisco SD-WAN Read SD-WAN blogs Why now for SD-WAN? The traditional WAN The traditional WAN (wide-area network) function was to connect users at the branch or campus to applications hosted on servers in the data center. Typically, dedicated Multiprotocol Label Switching ( MPLS ) circuits were used to help ensure security and reliable connectivity. This doesn't work in a cloud-centric world. Today's IT challenges Times have changed. As businesses adopt the use of software-as-a-service ( SaaS ) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) applications in multiple clouds, IT is realizing that the user application experience is poor. That is because WANs designed for a different era are not ready for the unprecedented explosion of WAN traffic that cloud adoption brings. That traffic causes management complexity, application-performance unpredictability, and data vulnerability. Further, opening the enterprise to the Internet and the cloud exposes major threat and compliance issues. It is extremely challenging to protect the critical assets of an enterprise when applications are accessed by a diverse workforce, including employees, partners, contractors, vendors, and guests. Enabling broadband on the WAN makes the security requirements more acute, creating challenges for IT in balancing user experience, security, and complexity. The new WAN New business models drive the need for a new network model. SD-WAN addresses the current IT challenges. This new approach to network connectivity can lower operational costs and improve resource usage for multisite deployments. Network administrators can use bandwidth more efficiently and can help ensure high levels of performance for critical applications without sacrificing security or data privacy. What are the benefits of SD-WAN? The traditional WAN architecture was limited to enterprise, branch, and data center. Once an organization adopts cloud-based applications in the form of SaaS and IaaS, its WAN architecture experiences an explosion of traffic accessing applications distributed across the globe. These changes have multiple implications for IT. Employee productivity may be compromised by SaaS-application performance problems. WAN expenses can rise with inefficient use of dedicated and backup circuits. IT fights a daily, complex battle of connecting multiple types of users with multiple types of devices to multiple cloud environments. With SD-WAN, IT can deliver routing, threat protection, efficient offloading of expensive circuits, and simplification of WAN network management. Business benefits can include the following: Better application experience High availability, with predictable service, for all critical enterprise applications Multiple hybrid active-active links for all network scenarios Dynamically routed application traffic with application-aware routing, for efficient delivery and improved user experience Improved OpEx, replacing expensive MPLS services with more economical and flexible broadband (including secure VPN connections) More security Application-aware policies with end-to-end segmentation and real-time access control Integrated threat protection enforced at the right place Secure traffic across broadband Internet and into the cloud Distribute security to the branch and remote endpoints with next-generation firewall ( NGFW ), domain name system (DNS) security, and Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV) Optimized cloud connectivity Seamless extension of the WAN to multiple public clouds Real-time optimized performance for Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, and other major SaaS applications Optimized workflows for cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure Simplified management A single, centralized, cloud-delivered management dashboard for configuration and management of WAN, cloud, and security Template-based, zero-touch provisioning for all locations: branch, campus, and cloud Detailed reporting of application and WAN performance for business analytics and bandwidth forcasting Read IDC report MPLS vs SD-WAN SD-WAN evolved from MPLS technology, which has powered private connectivity for more than two decades. In many ways, SD-WAN can be seen as a software abstraction of MPLS technology that's applicable to wider scenarios: It brings secure, private connectivity that's agnostic to all kinds of links and providers and is cloud-aware. While MPLS handled failure scenarios with backup links, SD-WAN handles them with real-time traffic steering based on centralized policy. Also, since SD-WAN unifies the entire WAN backbone, it delivers comprehensive analytics across the network globally. This wasn't possible before, because of disparate pieces of infrastructure and policy. SDN vs SD-WAN SD-WAN can be seen as software defined networking (SDN) for the WAN. It represents, arguably, the most popular and widely deployed use case in SDN. The SDN model became popular for abstracting network infrastructure in the data center and other sections within the enterprise perimeter. SD-WAN played a similar role but needed to abstract infrastructure elements that were diverse in terms of link types, providers, and geographies. Since it crossed the enterprise perimeter, it needed a robust security component as well. Deploying Cisco SD-WAN Cisco SD-WAN Extend intent-based networking across the branch, WAN, and cloud.

Software-defined Wide Area Networking provides secure, reliable connectivity between branch and remote locations. Unified SASE for Dummies 2025 THREAT LANDSCAPE REPORT Definition SD WAN Benefits SD-WAN vs MPLS Integrated SD-WAN FAQs Definition Definition SD WAN Benefits SD-WAN vs MPLS Integrated SD-WAN FAQs SD-WAN Defined and Explained A Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) is a networking technology that leverages software-defined networking (SDN) principles to enhance WAN performance. Understanding the differences between SD-WAN and SDN can help organizations choose the right architecture for their needs, ensuring both performance optimization and simplified management. SD-WANs provide secure, reliable, and scalable connectivity across various locations while centralizing management and visibility over the network. The traditional WAN (wide-area network) function was to connect users at the branch or campus to applications hosted on servers in the data center. Typically, dedicated MPLS circuits were used to help ensure security and reliable connectivity. This has driven Software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) solutions to become increasingly popular as organizations request fast, scalable, and flexible connectivity among different network environments. They also seek to lower the overall total cost of ownership (TCO) while delivering enhanced application performance. But a subpar SD-WAN approach can significantly inhibit an organization’s ability to quickly adapt to changing business demands, especially if it does not offer integrated security. Why is SD-WAN important? SD-WAN technology is important as it enhances network performance across wide area networks and offers better performance, increased security, and flexibility. SD-WANs optimize data flow based on current network conditions, application needs, and pre-defined policies, allowing greater control without sacrificing performance or incurring high costs. The key benefit of SD-WAN technology is that it can identify the best possible routes for traffic, and this simplification improves overall speed and service quality. How Does SD-WAN Work? SD-WAN modernizes WAN architecture by virtualizing connectivity. It intelligently routes traffic across multiple connection types, including MPLS, broadband internet, and LTE. This optimizes network performance and ensures reliable access to critical applications. SD-WAN leverages a centralized control plane, simplifying network management. This software-defined architecture enables administrators to define and enforce policies across the entire network in real-time. Learn more about the differences between SD-WAN and SDN. Security is also enhanced through integrated features like next-generation firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. This protects against evolving cyber threats and safeguards sensitive data. With SD-WAN, businesses can achieve higher performance, improved security, and simplified management, all while lowering SD-WAN cost compared to traditional WAN approaches. What Is SD-WAN Used For? In a nutshell, SD-WAN is used for security. But what is SD-WAN’s purpose when working towards specific business outcomes? Better application experience SD-WAN allows remote sites to connect more easily to networks, data centers, and/or multiple-clouds with lower latency , better performance, and more reliable connectivity. When users demand more of their applications and infrastructure at unprecedented agility and scale, an appealing user experience can be make-or-break. Instant ROI benefits MPLS and other connectivity technologies aren’t just outdated; they’re also more expensive when the total cost of ownership (TCO) is considered. SD-WAN not only significantly reduces bandwidth costs but can also help reduce capital costs by allowing consolidation of different point networking and security products at the edge while delivering better control and performance. Efficient operations As network infrastructures have evolved, the sprawl of point products used for networking and security increases complexity. SD-WAN uses automation to make connectivity a simpler process across mixed environments, including on-premises, hybrid, and cloud. SD-WAN enables centralized orchestration, zero-touch provisioning, and analytics along with deep integrations of cloud on-ramps to accelerate cloud connectivity. Enhanced security posture An SD-WAN solution needs to have integrated security. Otherwise, it’s just another connectivity option that unfortunately becomes an attack vector. When properly implemented, secure SD-WAN enables private, secure and direct internet access. It’s critical that an SD-WAN solution can ensure consistent security at all edges, from flexible WAN edges to the cloud edge.

One of the critical requirements for SD-WAN success is fully integrated security. Without it, SD-WAN becomes just another attack vector. A secure SD‑WAN as a Service model is explicitly designed to interoperate as a single offering, ideally with each element running on the same operating system and managed using a single-pane-of-glass interface. This ensures that transactions are all seen and inspected, and any threats or anomalous behaviors are shared between every solution for maximum protection. As part of such an integrated monitoring system, the networking and connectivity functionalities of an SD-WAN aren’t just more closely associated with the security solutions installed on the platform. They’re the same thing. Deployment of security piecemeal is also unwise. Because of the dynamic nature and high scalability of SD-WAN, overlay security is not only very expensive to deploy and maintain, but often ends up with delays when reacting to connectivity changes, leaving critical connections and data vulnerable. An integrated system ensures that SD-WAN connectivity, traffic management functions, and advanced security function as a single, holistic solution. An NGFW, whose key components include intrusion prevention (IPS), web filtering , secure sockets layer (SSL) inspection, and anti-malware, is an example of an integrated solution. Solutions that combine SD-WAN and next-generation firewall (NGFW) capabilities into single offerings satisfy the key requirements for secure SD-WAN—and ensure the safety and reliability of connections for the organization overall. For enterprises evaluating deployment models, reviewing essential SD-WAN security considerations helps ensure that both performance and protection requirements are consistently met. As enterprises adopt remote workforce policies, networks grow more distributed. A new networking and security strategy is required that combines network and security functions with WAN capabilities to support the dynamic, secure internet access for a “work from anywhere” global workforce. SD-WAN plays a critical role in the adoption of emerging solutions like Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and enables flexible and consistent security across all edges.

Integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into SD-WAN Integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into SD-WAN management marks a significant advancement in network operations. By harnessing GenAI's capacity to learn from extensive datasets and produce valuable insights, organizations can optimize and expedite various phases of the SD-WAN lifecycle. Day 0 - Simplified Deployment: Setting up an SD-WAN traditionally involved complex configurations and manual interventions. GenAI can automate many of these tasks, analyzing network requirements and generating optimal configurations, thus reducing deployment time and minimizing errors. Day 1 - Intelligent Operations: Managing and optimizing an SD-WAN network requires continuous monitoring and adjustments. GenAI can analyze network traffic patterns, identify potential bottlenecks, and suggest configuration changes in advance to maintain optimal performance. This intelligent automation reduces the burden on IT teams and allows them to focus on strategic initiatives. Day 2 - Predictive Scaling: As businesses grow and evolve, their network needs change. GenAI can analyze historical data and current trends to predict future network requirements, organizations can scale their SD-WAN infrastructure in anticipation of future needs. This foresight helps prevent performance issues and keeps the network aligned with business objectives. Incorporating GenAI into SD-WAN management equips organizations to attain heightened agility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By automating routine tasks and providing intelligent insights, GenAI frees up IT resources, reduces operational complexity, and allows businesses to focus on innovation and growth. Integrating digital experience monitoring with SD-WAN In the modern business environment, where applications are vital, a smooth end-user experience becomes indispensable. By focusing on the end-user experience, organizations can maintain optimal application performance, leading to increased productivity, improved customer satisfaction, and a competitive advantage in the digital marketplace. A digital experience monitoring ( DEM ) platform captures real-time data on user interactions with applications, offering insights into factors like latency, packet loss , and jitter. By correlating this data with SD-WAN telemetry, organizations gain a comprehensive understanding of how network conditions affect the end-user experience. This deeper visibility allows IT teams to: Identify and troubleshoot performance issues: DEM can pinpoint the root cause of slowdowns or disruptions, whether they originate in the network, the application, or the end-user device. Prioritize remediation efforts: By understanding how performance issues affect users, IT teams can prioritize addressing the most critical problems. Optimize application delivery: DEM data can be used to fine-tune SD-WAN policies, guaranteeing that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and prioritization. Integrating DEM with SD-WAN shifts network management from a reactive to a proactive approach. By prioritizing the end-user experience, organizations can maintain optimal application performance, resulting in increased productivity, improved customer satisfaction, and a competitive edge.

( July 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) In computing , the term remote desktop refers to a software - or operating system feature that allows a personal computer 's desktop environment to be run remotely from one system (usually a PC, but the concept applies equally to a server or a smartphone ), while being displayed on a separate client device . Remote desktop applications have varying features. Some allow attaching to an existing user's session and ""remote controlling"", either displaying the remote control session or blanking the screen. Taking over a desktop remotely is a form of remote administration. Overview [ edit ] Remote access can also be explained as the remote control of a computer by using another device connected via the internet or another network. This is widely used by many computer manufacturers and large businesses help desks for technical troubleshooting of their customer's problems. Remote desktop software captures the mouse and keyboard inputs from the local computer (client) and sends them to the remote computer (server). [ 1 ] The remote computer in turn sends the display commands to the local computer. When applications with many graphics including video or 3D models need to be controlled remotely, a remote workstation software that sends the pixels rather than the display commands must be used to provide a smooth, like-local experience. Remote desktop sharing is accomplished through a common client/server model. The client, or VNC viewer, is installed on a local computer and then connects via a network to a server component, which is installed on the remote computer. In a typical VNC session, all keystrokes and mouse clicks are registered as if the client were actually performing tasks on the end-user machine. [ 2 ] Remote desktops also have a major advantage for security development, companies are able to permit software engineers who may be dispersed geographically to operate and develop from a computer which can be held within the companies office or cloud environment. The target computer in a remote desktop scenario is still able to access all of its core functions. Many of these core functions, including the main clipboard , can be shared between the target computer and remote desktop client. Following the onset of COVID-19 , the shift to remote-work environments has led many to work from home with devices without enterprise IT support. As a result, these workers were reliant on remote desktop software to collaborate and keep their systems available and secure. [ 3 ] Uses [ edit ] A main use of remote desktop software is remote administration and remote implementation. This need arises when software buyers are far away from their software vendor. Most remote access software can be used for "" headless computers "": instead of each computer having its own monitor, keyboard, and mouse, or using a KVM switch , one computer can have a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and remote control software, and control many headless computers. The duplicate desktop mode is useful for user support and education. Remote control software combined with telephone communication can be nearly as helpful for novice computer-users as if the support staff were actually there. Remote desktop software can be used to access a remote computer: a physical personal computer to which a user does not have physical access, but that can be accessed or interacted with. [ 4 ] Unlike servers , remote computers are mainly used for peer to peer connections, where one device is unattended. A remote computer connection is generally only possible if both devices have a network connection. Since the advent of cloud computing remote desktop software can be housed on USB hardware devices , allowing users to connect the device to any PC connected to their network or the Internet and recreate their desktop via a connection to the cloud. This model avoids one problem with remote desktop software, which requires the local computer to be switched on at the time when the user wishes to access it remotely. (It is possible with a router with C2S VPN support, and wake on LAN equipment, to establish a virtual private network (VPN) connection with the router over the Internet if not connected to the LAN , switch on a computer connected to the router, then connect to it.) Remote desktop products are available in three models: hosted service, software, and appliance. Tech support scammers use remote desktop software to connect to their victim's computer and will often lock out the computer if the victim does not cooperate. Protocols [ edit ] Remote desktop protocols include the following: Apple Remote Desktop Protocol (ARD) –  Original protocol for Apple Remote Desktop on macOS machines. Appliance Link Protocol (ALP) –  a Sun Microsystems -specific protocol featuring audio (play and record), remote printing, remote USB , accelerated video HP Remote Graphics Software (RGS) –  a proprietary protocol designed by Hewlett-Packard specifically for high end workstation remoting and collaboration. Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) –  a proprietary protocol designed by Citrix Systems NX technology (NX) a proprietary protocol designed by NoMachine with open-source derivatives available from other forked projects. PC-over-IP (PCoIP) –  a proprietary protocol used by VMware (licensed from Teradici ) [ 5 ] Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) –  a Windows -specific protocol featuring audio and remote printing Remote Frame Buffer Protocol (RFB) –  A framebuffer level cross-platform protocol that VNC is based on. SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments) – remote-display system built for virtual environments by Qumranet , now Red Hat Xpra –  a protocol originally developed for forwarding X11 application seamlessly with audio, video, remote printing, etc. – extended to support Windows and macOS servers X Window System (X11) –  a well-established cross-platform protocol mainly used for displaying local applications; X11 is network-transparent Wake-on-LAN –  a standard protocol for remotely waking up computers that are in low-power mode (turned off, but still have access to a power source). Malicious variants [ edit ] A remote access trojan ( RAT , sometimes called creepware ) [ 6 ] is a type of malware that controls a system through a remote network connection. While desktop sharing and remote administration have many legal uses, ""RAT"" connotes criminal or malicious activity.  A RAT is typically installed without the victim's knowledge, often as payload of a Trojan horse , and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from computer security software and other anti-virus software.

What Is Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)? Learn about ZTNA and how it provides secure, adaptive, and segmented access to applications and resources. Discover Microsoft Entra Private Access Introduction Introduction ZTNA importance ZTNA vs. other models Mechanics Benefits ZTNA evolved ZTNA and SASE Solutions Resources FAQ READ TIME 10 min Introduction to Zero Trust Network Access Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is a security model that provides secure, adaptive, and segmented access to applications and resources. It’s based on the principle of verify explicitly, use least privilege, and assume breach. Unlike traditional security models that operate with a perimeter-based approach—which trusts anything inside the network and focuses security on the perimeter—ZTNA continually verifies every access request regardless of location, user, or device. It assumes that every user, device, or network segment is a potential threat, and enforces strong, identity-centric access controls at every stage. Key takeaways Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is a security model that provides secure, adaptive, and segmented access to applications and resources. It provides adaptable and resilient cybersecurity to secure access for the hybrid workforce at global scale. Traditional security relies on securing the network perimeter, while ZTNA treats every access attempt as potentially risky, regardless of location. Benefits include increased visibility into network activity, scalability and flexibility, and minimized impact of potential breaches. ZTNA importance Importance of ZTNA Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is important because it aligns with the growing need for adaptable, resilient cybersecurity in an increasingly distributed, digital-first workplace. Here’s why it has become a critical framework: Protection against evolving threats. Traditional security models, which grant broad network access to internal users, are insufficient against today’s sophisticated cyberthreats, especially insider threats or threats arising from compromised credentials. ZTNA assumes that no entity is inherently trusted, limiting potential attack vectors. Support for remote work and cloud-based resources. With the rise of remote work and cloud adoption, businesses are shifting away from traditional on-premises networks to hybrid or fully cloud-based infrastructures. ZTNA provides secure access to resources from any location, enforcing security policies consistently across on-premises and cloud environments. Mitigation of lateral movement in cyberattacks. In a security breach scenario, ZTNA’s segmented access prevents lateral movement by attackers, limiting the scope of potential damage. Since access is granted only on a need-to-know basis, attackers find it much more difficult to move between systems and gain access to critical assets. ZTNA provides numerous benefits for businesses including: Enhanced security. ZTNA’s model of continuous identity and device verification reduces the risk of unauthorized access and mitigates threats from compromised credentials. By verifying each access attempt based on factors like identity, location, and device health, ZTNA strengthens overall security posture and minimizes unauthorized access. Improved access control and policy enforcement. ZTNA allows organizations to enforce granular, role-based access policies. Users are granted access only to the applications or resources they need, reducing the chances of accidental or intentional access to sensitive data. It also simplifies compliance with data protection and privacy regulations by ensuring that access is limited and logged. Reduced attack surface. Since ZTNA doesn’t expose the entire network to any single user or device, it reduces the attack surface significantly. Only authorized users and devices can access specific resources, and they can only access them via secure, encrypted connections, lowering the risk of a data breach or unauthorized exposure. ZTNA vs. other models ZTNA vs. traditional security models Traditional security models primarily rely on the concept of a ""trusted"" internal network and an ""untrusted"" external network, secured by firewalls and VPNs. Key differences between Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and these traditional models include: Perimeter-based versus identity-based. Traditional security relies on securing the network perimeter, assuming users within the network are trusted. ZTNA treats every access attempt as potentially risky, regardless of location, requiring identity verification each time. Implicit versus explicit trust. In traditional models, once authenticated, users are trusted and often move laterally within the network with little restriction. ZTNA, however, implements micro-segmentation and least-privilege access to limit lateral movement and reduce risks associated with compromised credentials. Static versus dynamic access control. Legacy security models typically have static rules, which are less flexible and often outdated in today’s environments. ZTNA uses dynamic policies that adapt based on risk factors, user behavior, and other contextual cues. VPN versus direct, secure access. Traditional network connectivity models often use VPNs for remote access, which can introduce latency and are challenging to scale. ZTNA solutions provide secure access directly to applications without routing all traffic through a VPN, improving performance and scalability. Mechanics Mechanics of ZTNA Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) is part of the Security Service Edge framework and is used to secure access to private resources built on Zero Trust principles. In a ZTNA environment, users, devices, and applications must continuously prove their legitimacy before accessing resources, regardless of their location within or outside the network. Key operational mechanics include: Identity and access management . ZTNA starts with strict identity verification. Each user or device must authenticate their identity, often through multi-factor authentication (MFA), before gaining access to any application or resource. This ensures only legitimate users are identified and granted access. Micro-segmentation. Instead of relying on a single network perimeter, ZTNA divides the network into smaller, isolated segments. Each segment contains specific resources or applications, making it difficult for attackers to move laterally within the network if they compromise one segment. Least privilege access. Each user and device is granted access only to the specific applications or data necessary for their roles, limiting potential exposure. This least privilege approach minimizes the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access by limiting what any one compromised account can access. Application-level access. Rather than granting broad network-level access, ZTNA supports application-specific connections. This means that even if a device is granted access, it only communicates with the specific application or resource it’s authorized to access. It further reduces the attack surface, as users and devices don’t have visibility or access to the entire network. Continuous access evaluation. Continuous evaluation of user and device behavior is a central component of ZTNA. This includes monitoring for any unusual activity patterns, device posture (such as whether security updates are installed), and changes in location. When anomalies are detected, access may be revoked or additional authentication required. BENEFITS Benefits of Zero Trust Network Access Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) offers a range of benefits. It’s an attractive security framework given today’s increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats. Increased visibility ZTNA provides a centralized view of all access requests and network activity, enabling real-time monitoring and auditing. This visibility is critical for identifying and mitigating risks early, as well as for compliance reporting and understanding user behavior patterns. Scalability and flexibility ZTNA’s cloud-based approach to security is scalable and adaptable. As a business grows, adds resources, or adopts new applications, ZTNA accommodates these changes without requiring extensive reconfigurations. It supports a hybrid workforce by providing seamless, secure access regardless of users’ locations. Minimized impact of potential breaches By limiting access to specific applications and isolating the network, ZTNA minimizes the scope of potential damage in case of a breach. Should an attacker gain access, they’re typically contained to the specific segment they infiltrated, reducing the risk of significant data loss or operational disruption. Ease of demonstrating compliance By limiting access to only authorized users and continuously monitoring activity, ZTNA helps organizations meet regulatory standards for data security and protection, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. Its fine-grained access controls provide a clear audit trail for demonstrating compliance. Reduced risk of insider threats With the least privilege access model, ZTNA restricts users to only the resources necessary for their roles. This limits the potential damage a compromised account or a malicious insider could cause. Reduced Reliance on VPNs With ZTNA, there's less dependency on traditional VPNs, which are complex to manage, particularly at scale. This also improves user experience and reduces the performance bottlenecks commonly associated with VPNs. Enhanced user experience ZTNA provides faster, more direct access to applications than traditional VPN-based access, reducing latency and improving productivity for remote and mobile users. With continuous authentication and adaptive security, users enjoy a balance of security and convenience, as they only need to reauthenticate when risk levels change. ZTNA evolved The evolution of ZTNA Zero Trust Network continues to evolve to address the growing complexities of modern cyberthreats and remote work environments. Initially, ZTNA introduced the core principles of Zero Trust by providing access based on user identity and device posture rather than traditional network perimeter defenses. However, as cyberthreats have evolved, so has the need for a more comprehensive and adaptive approach, leading to the development of advancements in ZTNA including: Granular application access control. ZTNA now provides more detailed access control at the application level, moving beyond simple network or IP-based access. It ensures that users have access only to the specific applications and resources they need, and within those applications, limits them to the specific data and operations they’re authorized to perform. Continuous trust assessment. Traditional ZTNA generally relied on a one-time trust assessment at the start of a session. ZTNA now adopts a continuous trust model, evaluating user and device behavior dynamically throughout the session. Continuous monitoring helps detect and respond to anomalies or risky behavior in real-time. Integrated threat prevention. ZTNA now integrates threat prevention capabilities, such as malware detection, intrusion prevention, and other security checks, directly into the access model. This proactive security layer helps prevent attackers from moving laterally within a network even if they gain initial access. Enhanced user and device context awareness. ZTNA now goes beyond just verifying user identity and device posture, incorporating more contextual factors such as user behavior patterns, device history, and environmental factors like geolocation and time of access. This helps create a more precise risk profile for each access request. ZTNA and SASE ZTNA with secure access service edge Secure access service edge (SASE) is a cybersecurity framework that combines networking and security services in a unified, cloud-native model. It aims to provide secure access to users regardless of their location by integrating security functions—like secure web gateways, cloud access security brokers , firewall-as-a-service, and Zero Trust Network Access—with wide-area networking capabilities. SASE offers a scalable, flexible way to secure a distributed workforce, especially useful in modern environments where remote work and multi-cloud environments are standard. ZTNA is a key component within the SASE model, focused specifically on access control based on Zero Trust architecture . While ZTNA enforces strict access controls at the application and resource level, SASE broadens this scope by providing a comprehensive security and networking model. In essence, ZTNA is a critical element of SASE, focusing on fine-grained access management, while SASE incorporates ZTNA within a larger set of security tools to provide unified, end-to-end protection across the entire network.

What Is Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)? Zero trust network access (ZTNA) is a set of technologies that enable secure remote access to internal applications. Trust is never granted implicitly, and access is granted on a need-to-know, least-privileged basis defined by granular policies. ZTNA gives users secure connectivity to private apps without placing them on the network or exposing apps to the internet. Master the Zero Trust Approach to Security Zero Trust Hybrid Workforce Digital Experience Monitoring Why It Matters How It Works ZTNA vs. VPN Benefits of ZTNA Use Cases Implementation Zscaler ZTNA Suggested Resources FAQ Related Topics Why Does ZTNA Matter Today? The future of work is distributed, and remote workforces and cloud workloads demand secure remote access. However, traditional remote access solutions like virtual private networks (VPNs) are not flexible or granular enough for distributed environments, increasing breach risks. This is a key reason 65% of enterprises recently reported plans to replace their VPNs with a solution such as ZTNA. How Does ZTNA Work? ZTNA provides secure remote access to internal applications for any user, from anywhere, without putting critical resources at risk. To accomplish this, it starts with an architecture that's fundamentally different from a network-centric solution. Relying on a software-defined perimeter (SDP) , ZTNA enforces secure, identity-based access controls. This helps organizations replace their VPNs while reducing dependence on tools like DDoS protection, global load balancing, and firewalls. Following four core principles, ZTNA: Completely isolates app access from network access. This reduces risks such as infection by compromised devices, granting only authorized users access to specific applications. Makes network and app infrastructure invisible to unauthorized users. Outbound-only connections ensure IPs are never exposed to the internet, making the network impossible to find. Grants authorized users app access on a one-to-one basis. Native app segmentation means users only have access to specific apps, not the full network, eliminating the risk of lateral movement. Takes a user-to-app approach, not a perimeter security approach. The internet becomes the new corporate network, using end-to-end encrypted microtunnels instead of dedicated MPLS. What’s the Difference Between VPN and ZTNA? The key difference between these remote access solutions is how they provide that access. VPN VPNs give users access to a network and its resources through an encrypted, private tunnel. For many years, they were sufficient for users who worked remotely on occasion. However, cloud and remote work trends in the mid-to-late 2010s began to highlight shortcomings in the VPN approach. Lack of scalability makes it difficult to apply security policies for remote workers and clouds, and hinders user experiences. Deploying and maintaining VPNs across sprawling distributed ecosystems is time-consuming and expensive. VPNs create a broad attack surface, enabling any user with valid credentials to move laterally throughout the network. ZTNA ZTNA provides secure least-privileged access. Instead of granting trust based only on credentials, it verifies users based on a breadth of context, including device, location, and identity, for every access request. Once verified, users receive direct application access rather than network-wide access. Granular access controls prevent lateral movement by restricting users to only the resources they need. Direct user-to-application connections improve performance and optimize user experiences. Context-based authentication enhances security by verifying multiple factors before granting access. Operational Advantages of ZTNA With VPNs creating serious compliance and security risks, more and more organizations are discovering the advantages of ZTNA. Here are some of the top reasons to make the switch: No need for legacy appliances: Completely replace legacy remote access appliances, such as VPNs, with a 100% software-based solution. Seamless user experiences: Stop backhauling user traffic through the data center. Instead, grant users fast, direct access to applications. Effortless scale: Scale with ease as needs change over time, only requiring provisioning of additional licenses, not new deployments. Fast deployment: Deploy anywhere in just days, unlike appliance-based solutions that can take weeks or months to deploy. Security Benefits of ZTNA ZTNA helps organizations strengthen their overall security posture and agility by delivering: Invisible infrastructure: ZTNA gives authorized users access to applications, not the corporate network. This eliminates risk to the network while keeping infrastructure hidden. More control and visibility: A centralized admin portal offers simpler management and granular controls, with real-time visibility into all user and app activity, and dynamic policy enforcement for users or groups. App segmentation made simple: ZTNA enables granular segmentation at the application level, with no need to manage complex network-level segments. Integrated with SASE: ZTNA is a key part of the secure access service edge (SASE) model, combining with tools like SD-WAN and next-gen firewall (NGFW) in a unified, cloud native platform. Top ZTNA Use Cases While ZTNA has many use cases, most organizations start with one of these four. VPN Alternative VPNs are inconvenient and slow for users, difficult to manage, and offer poor security. More than half of organizations cite security and poor user experiences as the top challenges of VPN solutions. Reduce Third-Party Risk Most third-party users receive overprivileged access, and they largely use unmanaged devices, both of which introduce risks. ZTNA significantly reduces third-party risk by never providing direct network access and enforcing least-privileged access to apps. Accelerate M&A Integration M&A integrations can span multiple years as organizations converge networks and deal with overlapping IPs. ZTNA can provide direct app access with no need to converge networks or resolve IP overlap, significantly simplifying and speeding up M&A value capture. Secure Multicloud Access Securing hybrid and multicloud access is the most popular place for organizations to start their ZTNA journey. As more companies adopt the cloud, the vast majority are turning to ZTNA for security and access control for their multicloud strategies. How Does ZTNA Simplify Multicloud Access? ZTNA simplifies multicloud access by providing secure, direct connections between users and specific apps, wherever they are. It eliminates the need for complex network-level configurations or redundant VPNs, using identity-based authentication and granular access controls to unify security across clouds. How to Implement ZTNA Implementing ZTNA follows a phased approach designed to ensure smooth adoption, enhance security, and reduce risks: Phase 1: Start with remote users. Replace existing VPN solutions for remote access and map private app usage across your environment. Begin by defining access levels similar to current VPN settings to maintain productivity as users transition. Phase 2: Introduce microsegmentation. Identify critical applications and create granular access policies for specific user groups. Prioritize segmenting infrastructure servers and management ports to protect high-value resources first. Phase 3: Expand ZTNA to all users. Transition private app access for both remote and on-site users to ZTNA by configuring segments to route all resource access through encrypted microtunnels. Ensure context-based policies are applied universally. Key Considerations for Choosing the Right ZTNA Solution In today's crowded marketplace, it's important to consider several other key criteria when evaluating ZTNA solutions against your unique needs: Client requirements: Does the solution need an endpoint agent? What devices are supported? Agentless ZTNA is often critical for unmanaged device scenarios like BYOD and third-party access. Application support: Can both web and legacy (data center) applications benefit from the same security features? Cloud residency: Is the solution cloud-based? Does it meet security and residency needs? Cloud-delivered ZTNA often simplifies deployment and enhances DDoS resilience. Authentication standards: What protocols are supported? Can it integrate with on-premises directories, cloud identity services, or existing identity providers? Edge locations: How globally diverse are the vendor’s points of presence? Access control and posture: Does the offering evaluate device health and security posture? Can it integrate with unified endpoint management (UEM)?

What Others Are Saying… Score: 3/10 The Limits Of Free Faxing The Best Way To Fax Anything Most online fax services cost money, but there are some completely free fax services, and others which offer a free trial to users, in case you need to send a fax without paying anything. We have reviewed the best ways to fax for free below! Faxes were sent, but not a penny was spent in the making of this article. The good news is that there are ways to send a free fax. The bad news – it’s hard, and it took a lot of looking. There are many apps that include tricks like saying “ad free”, or “free download” in the title – plenty of apps look “free” on the app store, until you download them and realize it’s not a free fax app at all, you need to sign up and pay once you’ve installed it! Read on to discover how to send a fax completely free or jump straight to our final scores ! What Does “Free Faxing” Mean? We found a few different ways to send a “free” fax, which can be broken down into the two categories below: “Subscribe for a free trial and cancel” – this is where you have to sign up for something and provide your payment details, and can then cancel during the free trial before you get charged. This is still basically free, but some people might forget to cancel, or just not feel comfortable giving their credit card details over. Typically, these services are better because they give you free access to a top service for a short time. “No subscription, it really is just totally free to use” – there are some services where you don’t even have to commit to a subscription to be able to send a free fax – you can just start faxing. This is what most people would prefer, since you don’t need to sign up for anything. However, these options are generally worse than the ‘free trial’ faxing options. How We Reviewed Each Free Online Fax Service For the test, we used each service to fax a sample PDF document we found online – it has a good mix of text, graphics and color, so we’ll be able to see and compare how well each fax sends. We sent the exact same file using each free fax service. We have ranked every free fax service out of 10, with reviews that cover the following areas: The Good – What we like about it. The Bad – What we don’t like about it. How Secure Is It? – We know that faxing often involves sensitive information, and free fax services are likely to be less secure, so we’ll tell you how safe each one is to use for your information. What Others Are Saying – We’re all rightfully suspicious when something is “free”, so we’ll let you know what other people are saying about these fax services. Before we begin, as a disclaimer – it is not recommended to use a free fax online service to send and receive faxes containing sensitive information or confidential data. If you are dealing with taxes , insurance, healthcare , or anything else which is very important – I recommend signing up with a more premium paid service which can offer more customer support and security features than a free fax service. See our online fax services review for all options, both free and paid instead. Final Scores # eFax CocoFax GotFreeFax FaxBurner FaxZero Fax.Plus PamFax Subscription Needed?

Free trial for a week Any payment details required? Yes App or website? Website and mobile apps for Android and iPhone Send and receive faxes? Both My overall score: 9/10 eFax is a well-established fax services provider founded in the 1990s, which has been at the forefront of digital faxing ever since. eFax’s free trial period allows users to test the capability of eFax, and send faxes completely free. eFax offers a website with a faxing portal, but also mobile fax apps for Android and iPhone – giving you a huge amount of flexibility with your free trial. Read our full eFax review here. The Good… The flexibility of being able to use the website service, an Android or iPhone app offers more ways of faxing than any of the ‘totally free’ options, which are just website services. You can receive free faxes as part of your free trial. Easy cancellation process – we didn’t have to call or contact anybody, just click a few buttons and your subscription can be cancelled. eFax is the best service on this list in terms of fax quality – all graphics were captured perfectly, and when zooming in, there was excellent detail and clarity in the faxes. The quality is leagues higher a ‘totally free’ option listed above. eFax is a secure way of faxing sensitive information – so a free trial option to a service like eFax may be the best way to send important faxes with personal data. Here’s the image quality of the fax I’ve received from eFax: The Bad… Under a subscription plan, you would be limited to 30 faxes a month for both sending and receiving – and if you were to send or receive any international faxes, you would be charged extra – so this is not a free way to fax internationally, and overall not an excellent value proposition. For one month, you can send 150 faxes with a totally free service like FaxZero, without the need to sign up. eFax was out of fax numbers for a lot of the area codes we tried to sign up with. This could be a problem for people and businesses who need to be located in a certain area code – this was disappointing for such a premium service. How Secure Is It? eFax has an excellent reputation in the industry for top-tier security and regulatory compliance – they can even advise you on the regulatory limitations of a region you are faxing to. eFax is incredibly secure and one of the best online fax services for sending information you want to keep private. However, this free trial does not include HIPAA compliance, and so you will need to pay to get that protection from eFax using one of their HIPAA-compliant plans, in case you need to send or receive sensitive medical information. What Others Are Saying… eFax scores consistently highly as a paid fax service, and since this is essentially a free trial, you get all the benefits of being a fully-paid user for a limited amount of time. eFax gets very strong reviews from businesses and regular users, and is widely regarded as a leading fax service. For example, the Apple Store eFax app has a 4.7 average rating from over 28,000 reviews – a very good score. Score: 9/10 eFax is an outstanding service which is relied upon by large businesses for its clear and reliable faxing. The free trial was easy to set up, and more importantly, easy to cancel, and it provided the best quality fax on this list. If you don’t mind handing over credit card information, this is a top recommendation. Our final scores for the services we’ve reviewed are listed above – let’s go into each one below in more detail! #2: CocoFax – Free Trial Free trial subscription, or totally free to use? Totally Free Any payment details required? No App or website? Both Send and receive faxes? Only send Overall score: 8/10 CocoFax is a popular fax service used by individuals and enterprises, and includes a totally free trial which requires no commitment or credit card information. All you need is an email address to create a free account and start sending free faxes online. CocoFax will give new users a free fax number (however you won’t be able to receive faxes until you pay for a subscription), and they claim to offer you 10 free fax pages to send, after which point you must sign up to a plan. The features you can use when sending a new fax are limited compared to being on a paid plan, however you benefit from all the security that CocoFax has to offer, making this free option a strong proposition for people who don’t want to give any payment information away. The Good… Very good security features. You can use your CocoFax free trial on any of their platforms – web browser, windows computer, Android phone or email-to-fax. The fax quality was very good. CocoFax has an amazing range of connectivity with cloud storage services and supports multiple file types, even for users on a free account. You get your own personal free fax number under this free trial. CocoFax’s online dashboard is really clean and simple to use, replicating a popular email service like Google Mail or Outlook. There are no pushy sales tactics to get you to sign up to a paid subscription. CocoFax lets you integrate a free account with productivity and business services like Slack and Google workspace, so small businesses can test it out for free. You can fax internationally using the free trial. The Bad… Technically, you do not get 10 free pages with this free trial. Using a free account, you cannot turn off the cover page option, so a cover page will always be sent, and this counts towards your free pages. This means if you send one page, CocoFax also sends a cover page, and charges you for two pages! Then, if you want to include a message, CocoFax also puts the message on another page – so I was charged for 3 of my 10 free pages, just for sending one actual fax page! You cannot receive free faxes, you must pay before your account lets you receive faxes. How Secure Is It? CocoFax is without a doubt the best option for free, secure faxing without giving any payment information away. You get totally free HIPAA compliant faxes , and benefit from all the top data security measures such as 256-bit AES encryption, 2FA and firewall protections, as well as HIPAA, GDPR and PCI-DSS compliance. This is a very secure option. What Others Are Saying… CocoFax is consistently well reviewed on G2 , with a 4.7 out of 5 rating – this is better than fully paid fax services like HelloFax and Documo! It’s especially popular with business users, but regular users on GetApp also have good things to say about it, with a 4.3 out of 5 rating. Score: 8/10 If you’re looking to simply send a free fax, whilst providing no payment details and getting the best security and service out there – CocoFax is what we’d recommend. Unfortunately we cannot give it 10/10 due to it not actually being misleading about the number of fax pages you can send, but if you only want to send a few pages for free, we’d go with this! #3: GotFreeFax – Free Online Fax Service Free trial subscription, or totally free to use? Totally Free Any payment details required? No App or website? Website Send and receive faxes? Both Overall score: 8/10 GotFreeFax is a free online fax service which allows users to send a limited number of free faxes per day within the US and Canada. You get 2 free faxes per day, and 3 pages per fax, but you can send more with some paid plans. The website gets straight to the point – you simply fill in your details, the details of the fax recipient, type a message for a cover page if you like, and then upload files straight from your device. Click send, and you’re done! This is a quick way to send a short free fax online, without signing up for anything at all. The Good… There’s absolutely no sign-up or details from your credit card required – all that you need to do is verify your email account to send faxes online using GotFreeFax. Very hassle free. After accessing the website, a minute later we had already uploaded our fax documents, entered the details and the recipient’s fax number, and sent a fax. It arrived one minute later. This is a very fast service, great for quick occasional faxing. You get great email updates with the status of your fax, including a delivery confirmation email once it has arrived. We tried to enter the fax number in a variety of different formats and it recognised them all. You can receive faxes without having to commit to your own fax number – there’s a simple verification system which enables GotFreeFax to receive faxes on your behalf. No watermarks, branding or adverts included anywhere on your fax. You can upload your own custom cover page, or use theirs. The quality of the fax we sent was good – the file lost some clarity in the graphics and a few of the lighter images were lost, but it was very readable, and excellent for a free service with no login or payment details required. GotFreeFax fax page sent fax The Bad… Firstly, there’s quite a lot of ads. You can’t really complain since it’s a free service, but you will notice all the ads, they’re even on the email updates you receive. GotFreeFax doesn’t support many file formats – only 5, which means you might have to convert your files before sending them as faxes. How Secure Is It? GotFreeFax’s privacy policy mentions a few measures they take on their side to keep their internal systems and data safe, but as far as fax transmission goes, there is no mention of security features like encryption, or compliance with HIPAA or any other regulations. GotFreeFax is therefore not a recommended option for secure faxing. What Others Are Saying… GotFreeFax does what it says – it’ll send a quick free fax, without a fax machine needed, at a pretty average quality. It gets reviews to match that – TechRadar gave it a solid 4-star review which you can read for more detail. The fax quality isn’t excellent, but it’s totally free, so you can’t really complain. In case you’re wondering, there’s nothing malicious about it and it isn’t a scam – just a helpful free fax service. Score: 8/10 GotFreeFax ticks all the boxes as a quick, free and easy online fax service you can use from your computer or phone. Unless you’re faxing sensitive information or need more pages than the free service offers, then this is a really good free fax option, and it gets a strong recommendation.

No App or website? App and email-to-fax Send and receive faxes? Both Overall score: 7/10 FaxBurner is an online fax service with an iPhone or Android app, as well as the option to use email-to-fax with your preferred email account. A paid service, FaxBurner has a “Free” plan which users can sign up to and use without ever paying a penny, or even providing any payment details. The free plan with FaxBurner lets users send and receive faxes – however there are a few big limitations to each. For sending faxes, you can only send 5 fax pages in total before you’ll have to upgrade – it does not reset each month. For receiving faxes, you can receive up to 25 pages per month, forever, for free. However, you cannot keep your own fax number. Whenever you expect to receive faxes, you can receive a temporary fax number from FaxBurner – this number will be yours to receive faxes on for 24 hours, and then you will have to receive a new (and different) temporary fax number. The Good… No credit card details required, ever, in order to keep an account for use each month. Receive a small number of faxes each month for free, forever. A free mobile app which includes basic features like custom cover pages, e-signatures for signing documents, and cloud storage connectivity. Email-to-fax included as part of the free plan. Much better fax quality than the other ‘totally free’ fax services FaxZero and GotFreeFax. Strong customer feedback and high ratings on the app stores. The app is very simple and user-friendly. Good email updates whenever there is faxing activity on your account. You can always get your own private fax number, even if it is a temporary one. The Bad… You can only ever send 5 pages in total before you need to pay to upgrade – this does not reset every month. This makes FaxBurner a very limited free faxing option if you need to send pages. There is a large logo and branding on the cover pages in the faxes you send. Very little security and no HIPAA compliance. How Secure Is It? FaxBurner is not advised as a way of sending and receiving confidential or sensitive faxes – it is not HIPAA compliant (even under its highest paid plan), and very little detail is provided about the security FaxBurner does offer, it doesn’t even claim to encrypt transmissions, which would make it less secure than the average online faxing service. What Others Are Saying… FaxBurner has a very positive score on the Apple Store, with a 4.9/5 rating . They also frequently respond to good and bad reviews in a unique and engaging way – we even found one bad review which led them to refund a customer’s annual charge because they locked themselves out of their account. People are generally very satisfied with using FaxBurner as a low-cost or free online fax option. Score: 7/10 If you’ll never need to send many faxes, but want a quick and easy way of occasionally being able to receive some – and you don’t mind the relatively low level of security – then FaxBurner’s free plan is one of the best value offers in all of online faxing. FaxBurner is a totally free way of receiving up to 25 regular fax pages each month. Here’ss our full FaxBurner review #5: FaxZero – Free Online Fax Service Free trial subscription, or totally free to use? Totally Free Any payment details required? No App or website? Website Send and receive faxes? Only send Overall score: 7/10 FaxZero is a free online fax service which can be used on a computer or mobile device. This is a totally free service which requires none of your personal information, or payment details – just verify your email address and you’re good to go. FaxZero offers 5 free faxes per day, with a 3-pages limit on each fax, as well as an ‘almost free’ option which allows you to buy more faxes and send larger faxes. The Good… FaxZero supports a variety of file formats, over double the amount supported by GotFreeFax. The free fax limits are also bigger than GotFreeFax, with 5 faxes per day instead of 3 for regular users. FaxZero is designed to support political engagement – the website encourages you to fax your congressperson, governor or senator, with resources to help you identify and get in touch with those people. The Bad… FaxZero failed to recognise the format of our fax number at first – which meant the first attempt to send a fax failed. The FAQs section promises that it can recognise parentheses in fax numbers, but this didn’t happen for us. This could make it harder to send faxes, especially international faxes. There is no option to receive faxes with FaxZero. Our fax took a little longer to send – 3 minutes. The email updates from FaxZero were slower than other services, and went through to the spam folder – FaxZero warns you that its emails are blocked on certain services, which means they may not arrive at all, if for example you have an Outlook account. We weren’t impressed with the cover page under FaxZero – it is automatically branded, which can look unprofessional, plus the sender’s name was distorted and hard to read. The quality of the file sent was not good – the lighter-shaded graphics disappeared entirely, and GotFreeFax generally sent a clearer image – the pictures below show the detail that was lost, compared to other fax services. FaxZero fax page How Secure Is It? Similar to GotFreeFax, FaxZero is totally free and only makes money from ads, so you aren’t getting the highest security here, and there is no HIPAA compliance. You should only send faxes that are not confidential and sensitive using this service. On the plus side, FaxZero are very committed to not sending you any spam or junk mail, and keep secure servers, and claim to delete your fax data 3 days after you send your fax. What Others Are Saying… FaxZero is well-liked by the tech industry as a basic free fax provider, with TechRadar giving it 4-stars and PCMag giving it 3-stars , the latter saying “if you refuse to pay for a fax, it’s the best option”. Score: 7/10 FaxZero is a good alternative to GotFreeFax, standing out for offering more free faxes, and for encouraging people to participate in politics. However, we wouldn’t recommend it above GotFreeFax as an all-round fax service, due to the fax quality, branding, the inability to receive faxes, and some other factors. That said, it’s very useful as a free fax service if you need to quickly fire off a fax to a friend!

No App or website? Website and mobile apps for Android and iPhone Send and receive faxes? Only send My overall score: 6/10 Fax.Plus is an online faxing service from Alohi, and one of the top faxing apps on the Apple and Google Play stores. As a paid subscription, Fax.Plus is a good choice, and they have a page on their website promising a simple process to send a free fax online. Fax.Plus free fax page What I Like The Good… The user experience on the website and in the apps is very good compared to eFax, which feels much more dated and ‘Windows 95’ style. Fax.Plus feels like a more modern service. You don’t need to provide any payment information to unlock your 10 free fax pages. The fax quality was excellent, with lots of detail retained, however ultimately not quite as clear as the fax from eFax. Here’s the image quality for our Fax.Plus test: The Bad… The process is not as simple as the steps in the article on Fax.Plus’ website – you also need to provide your personal cell phone number in order to unlock 10 pages to send. You will need to pay money in order to receive faxes, as this is not offered under any free trial or plan – therefore, this cannot be considered a complete free fax service. You have no choice over the fax number your free fax comes from – ours was sent from a fax number registered in Switzerland. You can only 10 pages in total before you need to pay money. How Secure Is It? Whilst Fax.Plus lacks the more advanced features of eFax, it is still considered a very secure service to use, and a free trial includes the benefit of the security on offer. This is a safe service to send important documents with, however the free trial is not HIPAA compliant (only Fax.Plus’ most expensive option provides this), and so we wouldn’t recommend using it to send or receive sensitive medical information, either to healthcare providers or insurance companies. What Others Are Saying… Fax.Plus is a well-reviewed and leading online fax service, with a popular score of 4.7 on the Apple Store. It’s one of the leading faxing apps across multiple platforms, and consistently gets above average reviews. Score: 6/10 Ultimately, Fax.Plus is a great service if you’re paying for it, however as a free fax service it does fall short compared to others. You only get 10 pages in total, and the website does lead you to think that the free service is more than 10 pages, only revealing the details once you have signed up. #7: PamFax – 3 Free Fax Pages Free trial subscription, or totally free to use? Free to use, but limited to only 3 pages Any payment details required? No App or website? Website only Send and receive faxes? Only send Overall score: 3/10 PamFax is an online fax service offering a free trial of sending 3 fax pages, with no payment details needed. You can then purchase a plan to get your own fax number, and start sending and receiving more faxes. The Good… You can send a simple free fax with no payment details needed. You can receive notifications about your faxes from Skype, Telegram or Facebook using their bot. The Bad… The quality of our sent fax was just plain bad – we could barely read some of it and the shapes/pictures did not come through at all. Your free fax pages can only be sent to ‘zone 1’ destinations. We spent a long time trying to find what areas are included in this category, and were unable to find that information. No high-standard security features are offered. The website is just bad to use and appears very unprofessional – in the below picture you can see that the links don’t even appear correctly on the website. How Secure Is It? In their privacy policy, there is no mention of any advanced faxing security features such as E2E encryption, regulatory compliance, or data protection – just some very standard security features that most of the internet has. This is not recommended for faxing confidential information. What Others Are Saying… We’re not the only ones underwhelmed by PamFax – TechRadar reviewed their paid service and gave it 2.5 stars , finding that it missed key features and didn’t offer basic security features. Score: 3/10 PamFax is not a top suggestion when you search the internet for free faxing options, and we would suggest using an alternative. The Limits Of Free Faxing As we can see, there are a few half-decent ways to send a fax for free online, whether it’s no-strings attached, or a free trial you need to cancel after the fact. However, there are pretty clear limitations on the choices we could find: GotFreeFax: Bad quality, very limited number of free faxes. FaxZero: Very bad quality, limited number of free faxes. eFax: You need to remember to unsubscribe, lack of fax numbers in many area codes, and only 30 pages inbound and outbound for what is supposed to be a premium service. Fax.Plus: Only 10 pages in total, and you cannot receive any faxes. There’s also a few limitations they all have in common, one being page numbers – they all have a limit. The other limitation seems silly to say, but well, they’re free . This means you’re not a paying customer, so how can you expect to be treated like one? Faxing usually involves very important, sensitive, and private information being sent in stressful times of life – filing your taxes, arranging healthcare, signing a will, etc., all still widely use faxing. You might be better off using a service which offers flexibility, security, and which treats its customers with the care they deserve. The Best Way To Fax Anything Ultimately, you get what you pay for – take a look below at a side-by-side zoom-in between the fax from GotFreeFax, and Municorn’s Fax App , a mainstay on the Apple business charts as the most popular and well-reviewed fax app on the app store, with a 4.8/5 average from over 326,000 reviews. You can see the difference in detail, and clarity of the scan – you risk losing this important quality when using a free service. GotFreeFax vs Municorn fax quality comparison Whenever you fax anything remotely important (which is anything I fax!) , using Municorn gives you the following things that free services just can’t offer: Unlimited pages – sending and receiving Totally flexible, cancel-anytime subscriptions which can be weekly, monthly, or annually – no questions asked In-app customer support chat Your own fax number from any area code Perfect quality faxing for a huge number of file formats, or in-app document scanning Advanced data-encryption and privacy And much more… On top of that, Municorn’s app also gives you a free test fax so that you can see for yourself. Whether you’re just faxing your local congressperson using a free fax service, or sending important information via fax with a top service like Municorn, you should now know all the best ways you can start faxing today!

The content a business produces needs to reach customers in a way that feels organic and intentional. Content marketing provides an exceptional way of doing this; a robust content marketing strategy can make all the difference between a brand that resonates with its target audience and one that has trouble with conversions. In short, content marketing helps you grow your business and tell your brand’s story. It is the entire process behind creating, developing, producing, sharing and distributing content to your target audience. Your content can be as versatile as you’d like, from blog posts and landing page copy to podcasts, videos, infographics and social media blurbs. Content marketing can also support social media and other digital marketing efforts, such as lead generation and nurture programs. However, the content marketing landscape is a complex and competitive marketplace. While it is an effective way to drive business results and encourage conversions, a strong strategy needs to be in place to see the best results. Here are some content marketing best practices that will allow brands to tell their stories with ease. 16 Content Marketing Best Practices How exactly can content marketing help you meet your digital marketing goals? High-quality content marketing can help companies amplify their overall marketing strategies without putting too much of a strain on budgets. CMI found that content marketing generates three times as many leads as traditional outbound marketing but costs 62% less. Use these content marketing tips when building your content marketing strategy. 1. Take the Time to Strategize and Plan In order to make your content marketing work for you, an adequate strategy will need to be established. It helps to take some time to brainstorm and think carefully about what you want from your content marketing efforts. Do you want to raise awareness about your brand as a whole, or are you looking to highlight a new product or service? Do you want to stand out as a thought leader in your industry and boost your competitive advantage? The answers to these questions will inspire your strategy and plan going forward. During your brainstorming and content ideation processes, take the time to develop achievable goals. Every piece of content you produce should be based on research — meaning similar content has had a successful track record with others. But it is essential to keep in mind that your goals need to be attainable, not far-fetched and unrealistic. Depending on your needs, some examples of content marketing goals can be: •  Improve revenue • Generate great leads •  Increase conversions •  Boost brand awareness and authority within your industry’s niche •  Attract strategic partners •  Enhance your customer engagement •  Build rapport with both new and returning customers •  Stand out within your local market Need some inspiration? Look at your competitors and other brands you admire to get some ideas for your content themes and formats. From there, create an editorial calendar to keep your content production consistent. 2. Understand Your Audience Learning about your audience is essential in making informed decisions about what content you create for your audience. It is all about meeting their needs and digging deep into their motivations, behaviors, challenges and goals. Creating buyer personas or writing briefs can help facilitate this process. By conducting research, you will ultimately be able to create empathetic content marketing campaigns that resonate with your audience on another level. 3. Audit Your Existing Content Before you start generating new content, you’ll want to take a look at the content you have already produced. You can use the fact that you already have content to your advantage. Take a step back to examine what is already good about your content and what you can do to improve it. For example, are you active on social media, or do you have a blog with consistent and unique content? How are they performing, and do they get any interaction from your consumers? A content audit doesn’t have to be too challenging to complete, and chances are, you’ll already have a good idea of what is working for your brand and what is not. Additionally, sometimes you may be able to pause new content creation and instead focus on refreshing older content. A simple content refresh or optimization can help breathe a new life into an existing piece of content, instead of having to draft up something brand new. 4. Create Compelling Content You should target all the content you produce to the specific demographic you want to reach. Remember that consumers want content they’ve never seen before. So, create unique content that consumers won’t be able to find anywhere else. Plus, exclusivity is key. Behind-the-scenes content, interviews with company members and product how-tos are wonderful options for standing out in the crowd. When creating your content, ask yourself the following questions: •  What types of content would my ideal customer want to see? Are they looking for product tutorials, informational guides or broader thought leadership pieces? •  What kind of content will inspire consumers to keep coming back? Are the customers more likely to react to videos , blog posts or podcasts? •  What sets your business apart from your competitors? What makes you different? •  Are there topics or content pieces I can outsource to an industry expert or thought leader? The answers to these questions will help inspire your content creation process. 5. Provide a Mix of Evergreen and Topical Content In the realm of content marketing, evergreen content is content that is not time-sensitive. This type of content will always stay fresh, meaning it will always be relevant for your readers. There are plenty of benefits to investing in evergreen content, including: •  Providing a lot of value to audiences. The topics of evergreen content tend to stay relevant long after the initial publication date of the piece. No matter what season and year the reader finds the content, the information will be beneficial and informative. •  Continuing to drive traffic to the site months and years after publishing, since the piece still sparks interest and clicks. •  The ability to be updated when needed because of industry trends . This saves a lot of time for business owners in the long run, as they won’t have to constantly create new content. Standard evergreen content formats include listicles, “tips and tricks” articles, informational how-to product videos, product reviews and videos. Although evergreen content articles provide value to readers, prospects will also want to understand industry news and trends. By curating news from valuable sources or sharing expertise from the C-suite, companies can help their readers stay ahead of big shifts in their industry. A combination of these kinds of assets will help readers navigate best practices while demonstrating how new trends or developments in technology will influence their decision-making processes. 6. Personalize Your Content Remember that your overarching content marketing goal is to make sure you know your audience and what they want from you. Creating and curating the right mix of content requires a good understanding of the target audience and their pain points. For example, would your audience appreciate specific industry insights from trusted, third-party sources? Or would it help to put your business in perspective by incorporating news stories and photography within your cross-platform content strategy ? Personas, or detailed profiles of possible consumers, are a great tool for determining what would interest audiences. When brainstorming these personas, establish each target audience’s age, demographics, interests, jobs, income and lifestyle. Since you will have many different potential consumers, you’ll need to have multiple audience personas. Make sure you differentiate your content, either through the topic, format and presentation or through balancing a mix of original content and licensed news articles , for each audience. This way, each persona is appropriately targeted. 7. Use Analytics to Optimize and Improve There are many free tools available online, such as Google Analytics , that will give you a glimpse into your website’s performance. Taking a regular look into your website’s content performance will help you see if your content is performing to the best of its ability, as well as guarantee that consumers can easily access it. Search engines are run by algorithms, which dictate how search engines crawl, index and present your website’s information. These algorithms can change rapidly, and if your website is not technically sound, you may lose all the search engine optimization momentum you’ve already gained. So, it’s essential to use analytics to ensure that all your web pages are performing correctly. Additionally, analytics can provide insight into well-performing content topics and themes. Look at your content, and see which pieces got the most traffic, performed the best and created the most conversions. Look at which headlines got the most clicks and pay attention to the length of time readers stayed on the page. Take note of the common threads between your successful pieces of content and use this information to optimize both new and existing pieces. 8. Provide Value There is immense value in content marketing , but only if the content you create adds value to your audience. The content you are creating is paramount in answering your audience’s questions and building trust. Deliver value by educating your audience through blogs, infographics, podcasts, and interviews. Creating story-driven content tends to perform better than authoritative content by positioning yourself as a curator of knowledge. 9. Diversify Your Content Diversifying your content strategy means creating different kinds of content and expanding the types of topics and themes covered in previous assets. You are more likely to keep your audience interested if you keep things fresh. The following are great ways to expand your content: Blog Posts White Papers Ebooks Webinars News Content Thought Leadership Content Content Licensing Multilingual Content 10. Leverage Thought Leaders in Your Industry With Licensed Content Demonstrating thought leadership starts with choosing the best content for your desired topic. If you are looking for content written by world-class writers and journalists, licensed content can help. Using licensed content takes the hard work out of creating content that you know your audience will enjoy. With licensed content, business owners will: • Save time: Curating external content will increase your output while freeing up time to devote to developing your original content , start to finish. Additionally, by getting a comprehensive copyright license , businesses won't need to waste time navigating getting copyright permission individually for articles that would interest their audiences. • Diversify content: You want to stand out online, and when you consistently publish content with varying themes and topics, you will draw your audience back to you. • Establish brand credibility: Harnessing the worldwide journalistic expertise of NYTLicensing solutions will work to help you stand out in your industry. 11. Outsource Content We are all aware of how important content creation is when it comes to boosting your visibility and saving you copious amounts of time and money. Many companies do not have the time to maintain an editorial calendar that aligns with their business strategy nor one that manages to produce consistent fresh content. This is why outsourcing your content development and outsourcing your blog posts is the best way to maximize your content marketing efforts. In fact, 57% of the most successful companies in terms of content marketing are outsourcing at least some of their content efforts. 12. Promote Content Content promotion is the process of distributing content via both paid and organic channels. This may include platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, social media, industry publications, and email marketing. The goal of content promotion is to get the content out in front of as many people as possible. A strong content promotion strategy includes a multi-channel approach that connects with audiences, generates leads, cultivates loyalty, and drives awareness. Consider leveraging social media, curated content newsletters , industry publications, and your company website. 13. Repurpose Content It is no secret that repurposing content is the easiest way to save time and resources, drive traffic to your brand and grow your business and brand. Repurposing content just means reusing assets and content pieces in new formats across different channels. This can include turning blogs into podcasts, turning interviews into ebooks or repurposing content with a copyright license . Repurposing content should not be overwhelming, but if it is, content licensing is the easiest way to repurpose already successful content. 14. Showcase Industry News Showcasing industry news is a great way to establish your brand as a thought leader . Relevant news information can also help your audience make better decisions, as they navigate changes in their industry. 71% of industry leaders note that less than 50% of the thought leadership they read is delivering insights. By highlighting relevant news stories, your team can better connect with business leaders and decision-makers, who matter most to your business. However, many brands struggle to produce this kind of content regularly. With conflicting deadlines resulting from product launches or end-of-year sales goals, it can be difficult to dedicate the right team to researching industry news content, especially since most of it is time-sensitive. By partnering with reputable publications and licensing their content, your team can still showcase news and establish your brand as a thought leader with fewer resources. Since content is increasingly found behind a paywall, news curation is an effective strategy for brands to leverage. Since only 20% of Americans have a subscription to digital news, your team will be able to showcase unique content to your audience to build trust. 15. Create Goals for your Content It has now been proven that content marketing enhances your business and plays a significant role in the success of a company. It is difficult to maximize opportunities if there are no goals or strategies in place. Without proper methods of tracking progress, teams will have a harder time determining what tactics are effective and why. To successfully take advantage of content marketing, you need to set a clear attainable plan. By establishing clear content marketing goals and KPIs , your company can track insights like the number of leads, impressions, and conversions all of which will help you analyze and in turn, make informed smart decisions. 16. Consistency is Key Creating a content marketing plan is the key to remaining consistent in your strategy. So how do you create this “plan” and stay consistent? The answer: start an editorial calendar . The effectiveness and benefits of having an editorial calendar are endless. In fact, 80% of the most successful companies in content marketing are using a content calendar. Content Marketing Trends for 2024 As content marketing trends continue to evolve every single year, it is important for your business to stay up-to-date and relevant. 2024 will continue to push the boundaries and techniques of marketing. Let’s dive into some trends you should consider leveraging as we move into the new year! Get Started with Empathetic Content Marketing: Connection and building trust with potential consumers has never been harder, considering how much content is floating around on media channels, flooding social media, and overwhelming people’s inboxes. If you feel like your marketing campaigns are not resonating with your audience, you are likely to be missing empathy-based marketing . During the pandemic, AdvisorStream noted that its health and wellness articles were among its best-performing assets, although they are a financial marketing platform. Even in B2B, it’s important to go beyond mere personas and data to foster those connections. Combat Misinformation: Trustworthiness and credibility continue to be large problems in the media ecosystem. For healthcare content marketers, this distrust is especially important. One study in Singapore showed that misinformation led to people regularly rinsing their noses with saline and garlic to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, instead of the regulations related to social distancing. Additionally, in another survey, 36% of patients noted that they do not trust pharmaceutical companies. Due to the circulation and impact of misinformation and the lack of consumer trust, content marketers must be hyper-vigilant that their content is accurate and credible. Create Video Content: Video content marketing continues to be a great marketing format that helps drive your message and tone forward. High-quality video content helps you tell a story with visuals while developing a connection with your customers. Video allows businesses to show off their products and services with customer testimonials, product demonstrations, and behind-the-scenes footage content. Measure Content Regularly 75% of the companies semRush surveyed are conducting a content audit once a year. 65% of those that are most successful are conducting these audits at least twice a year. For companies looking to outpace their competition, it’s important to regularly monitor content performance, track goals, and audit performance. Your team should then adjust its approach based on your team’s findings. Final Thoughts The above best practices will ensure that your content works for — not against — you. With some consistency and time, these tips will amplify your brand and improve your content marketing efforts , which will help with customer conversions, leading you to ultimately grow your business .

The Complete Content Marketing Guide For 2025 Content marketing is an excellent strategy to make potential customers aware of your brand. The ‘content’ in content marketing could be a video, blog post, podcast, or social media post. As most potential customers often do some preliminary research before purchasing products or services, they’ll likely find your content before making a purchase decision. If your content is helpful, those potential customers are more likely to trust your brand and buy your products or services when they’re ready to make a purchase. The problem is that not all content marketing strategies are equally effective. You need to know what problems your potential customers are searching, what makes a piece of content convert, which content platforms they’re using, and how to work with platform algorithms to get in front of your potential customers. To help you implement an effective content marketing strategy, here’s a complete content marketing guide for 2024. Specifically, you’ll learn: What is content marketing? The key benefits of a successful content marketing strategy Different forms of content marketing How to execute a successful content strategy Some outstanding content marketing examples from B2B and B2C brands Want to get 6 courses, 10 ongoing education videos, and a lot more for just $1?

Content marketing is a form of inbound marketing that attracts users to your brand by providing useful or entertaining content – usually in the form of text, video, or audio. Content marketing is valuable to companies because it helps them build relationships and trust with their potential customers and existing customers at scale. As a result, it’s easier to sell your products faster. The ROI of content is notoriously difficult to measure as it’s often just one step in the customer journey, but brands with strong content marketing strategies tend to have lower customer acquisition costs and generate compounding returns. Content marketing also has a snowball effect, as those who use content marketing to build an audience see higher returns for each additional piece of content they publish. How Does Content Marketing Work? Effective content marketing attracts people to your brand. You might publish a video, podcast episode, or blog post, and then people interested in the topic consume it and become acquainted with your brand voice . Once you have that person’s attention, you can build a trusting relationship with them. As a result, you can sell them products and services. If you’re looking for content marketing and SEO services , check out Copyblogger’s agency Digital Commerce Partners . We specialize in delivering targeted organic traffic for profitable businesses. 4 Ways Content Marketing Can Help Your Business Companies with excellent content marketing strategies have an unfair advantage over their competitors for several reasons. Below we’ll discuss just a few of them. 1. Reduce Customer Acquisition Costs Quality content creation isn’t cheap, but you’ll see a stronger ROI from each piece of content you produce because your audience will grow. It’s a snowball effect. The first video, blog post, or social media post you publish might only be seen by a few people, but as more and more people find your content and become followers, each sequential piece of content you publish will be seen by more people and produce a stronger ROI. So unlike paid ads, where you and your competitors can earn roughly the same ROI for each dollar spent, brands with strong content marketing strategies and a large audience can earn significantly more for each piece of content published. 2. Improve Lead Quality Another benefit of content marketing is that you can filter the type of customers you attract based on the content you produce. For example, if your target audience is exclusively CMOs, you can discuss only topics that a CMO would be interested in, like hiring great talent. You might also offer access to exclusive reports on industry benchmarks that would interest a CMO. In contrast, paid ads force you to rely on the platforms to accurately identify your target audience. With privacy concerns on the rise and less accurate audience targeting, these platforms are producing lower returns. 3. Build a Stable Lead Pipeline Content marketing has a flywheel effect and produces higher returns over time – especially if you produce evergreen content. With evergreen content (content that is relevant for years), you can continue to generate returns from it even years after it was published. So even if you stop producing content for a period of time, you’ll still likely have a steady pipeline of leads thanks to your evergreen content. 4. Increase Customer Retention and Loyalty Content marketing is essentially a cheat code to build trust with your potential customers at scale. The more they become familiar with your brand’s viewpoints and identity, the easier it is to trust your brand and the more likely they are to continue purchasing from your brand. Forms of Content Marketing Content marketing can be any type of media across a variety of platforms, though the most common forms of content marketing include: Long-form text (Blog posts, white papers, case studies, etc.) Social media posts Video content Podcasts Emails Below we’ll discuss each of these types of content in detail and when you should use them. Long Form Written Content (Blogs, White Papers, Research, etc.) Blog posts are the bread and butter of the content marketing strategy for most B2B and even many B2C companies and local businesses. Blogging is valuable because it can help you rank in search engines for keywords that your ideal customers may search. For example, if you sell CRO software, ranking first in Google for the term “best CRO software” will help you drive valuable leads because those searchers are clearly looking to purchase a product like yours. The process of optimizing blog posts to rank at the top of Google is called SEO (search engine optimization) . While blog posts are excellent at generating organic traffic to your website, effective marketers know that they need to also provide a next step to move the visitor through the buyer journey and eventually convert them into a customer. Check out our guide to simple SEO and content marketing. Therefore, savvy content marketers often include a call to action in the blog posts to download a lead magnet, like a white paper or research study, in exchange for their email address. Once you have a website visitor’s email address, you can retarget them with other valuable content to move them through your marketing funnel. Another major benefit of long-form content like blog posts is that they often produce compounding results (assuming the content is evergreen or updated every few years). Social Media Posts Social media content is excellent for generating brand awareness, and many brands (particularly those in the B2C space) rely heavily on social media for audience building. Social media marketing is also becoming increasingly popular among B2B brands as more and more people turn to individual thought leaders for professional advice and industry news. LinkedIn’s revenue alone is an excellent reflection of the rise of B2B social media, as the platform grew 26.2% in 2022 to $14.5 billion – the highest percentage of growth it has seen in the past three years. The benefit of social media marketing is that you can develop relationships with your audience much more quickly, as it’s a very personal form of content marketing. The downside is that social media content isn’t evergreen, and the key to winning with social media marketing often comes down to publishing a high volume of high-quality content. This can be tricky as it’s important to publish high-quality content readers want to consume. Video Content Video content is also becoming increasingly common in B2B and B2C content marketing strategies, as it’s now easier than ever to record a high-quality video on even a simple iPhone. It’s also easier to quickly build a relationship with your audience if they can see and hear you, which is likely because body language makes it easier to trust a person. Video content is also excellent for content repurposing, as you can turn a single video into podcast episodes, social media clips, emails, or blog posts. The downside with video content is that the best video content usually features a person, so it might not be a great option if there isn’t anyone within the company who enjoys being on camera. In addition, the person on camera will likely become the face of the brand. If that person later leaves the company, the audience might leave as well. Podcasts There are more podcast listeners (and podcasters) than ever before. But even with the competition, starting a podcast is an effective way to grow your audience . When people hear your voice and stories repeatedly, it’s easy to quickly build a deeply loyal following. Podcasts also have very high retention as, unlike other forms of content marketing, the audience can passively consume your content. So, unlike videos or blog posts that require the listener’s undivided attention, they might multitask while listening to your podcast. Your podcast will also likely become part of that person’s routine, which makes the audience even stickier. For example, they might always listen to your podcast while driving to work or working out at the gym. Like video content, the downside of podcast content is that you’ll likely lose your audience if the podcast host decides to leave your company. Email Marketing Email marketing is arguably one of the best content formats because it’s the only platform you own entirely. Email marketing is also an essential part of e-commerce performance marketing . For example, a social media platform might change its algorithm, causing you to lose access to your audience, or a Google algorithm update could cause your blog content to drop in the search results, and you’ll lose organic traffic. However, after someone gives you their email address, you own that list and can retarget them until they unsubscribe because you aren’t at the mercy of a platform. Another benefit of email marketing is that the people on your email list have demonstrated interest in your company by giving you their email addresses, making them higher-quality prospects. A Simple 5-Step Process for Creating a Content Marketing Strategy Many content marketing efforts fail because they lack a solid content marketing strategy to attract the right prospects and nurture them through the buyer journey. If you randomly begin publishing content on different platforms without a thoughtful approach to which channels you’ll focus on, how you’ll position your brand, and how each piece of content moves the customer through the user journey, you’ll likely be disappointed by the ROI from your content marketing efforts. To solve these problems, here’s a step-by-step approach to creating a successful content marketing strategy . Step 1: Define Your Ideal Target Customer Content marketing only works if you attract the right customer. Otherwise, you’ll have low conversion rates or convert customers who are a poor fit for your product or service, creating unnecessary customer support headaches and high churn. To identify your ideal target customer, ask yourself these questions: What’s the title and position of the person who buys our product or service? What type of company does this person work at (size, industry, etc.)? What pain points does this person come to our brand to solve? What is the person’s knowledge level on this subject (this is key to avoiding beginner level keywords when you’re targeting advanced executives)? Once you answer those questions, you’ll have a good sense of your ideal buyer persona, and the rest of your content strategy will become clear. Step 2: Map Out Your Marketing Funnel And Choose Content Formats Most customers don’t make a purchase the first time they visit your website, and that’s okay. Content marketing aims to build a relationship with prospects to eventually lead them to make a purchase. There are several stages of the content marketing funnel, from awareness (the customer is just learning about the pain point and potential solutions) to the purchase decision phase (the customer is solution aware and ready to purchase a product to solve the pain point). Source For example, if your product automates accounting processes, here’s what the customer journey might look like: Read a blog post about the basics of business finances Watch a video about executing specific business finance topics like accounts payables/receivables Watch a webinar about how to automate all of these steps with your software Creating content for each of these phases of the customer’s research process is important so that you can lead them through the funnel to ultimately purchase your product or service. If you pitch your product too soon, you can lose trust. Yet if you never pitch your product, they’ll never convert. You’ll also notice that this marketing funnel has multiple different content formats. So how do you choose the best content format for your marketing funnel? It comes down to two variables: 1. What type of content do your customers already enjoy consuming? Some audiences gravitate more towards specific platforms than others. For example, most people don’t go to TikTok to hire a lawyer or marketing agency. However, TikTok would be an excellent place to sell beauty products. The good news is that you can quickly identify the most effective platforms by analyzing your competitors’ platforms. 2. What type of content will you be able to produce consistently? Even if you know that all of your competitors are producing video content, don’t try to create video content unless you know you can consistently publish high-quality video content. The key to winning with content marketing is consistency, so selecting a form of content you enjoy is important. Now that you know what content you’ll produce, you can map out the top, middle, and bottom-of-funnel content. It’s also worth noting that you don’t necessarily need a different form of content for each funnel stage. For example, you can create TOFU, MOFU, and BOFU content with just blog posts. The reason it’s important to map out your marketing funnel at this stage is to ensure you have a clear call to action at each step to move the visitor forward in the buyer journey. Step 3: Generate Content Ideas And Establish a Brand Voice An effective content marketing plan is about more than just mapping out the types of content that it will take to produce. You have to actually have something unique and interesting to say to get people to pay attention to your content. So the next step is to figure out how to consistently generate content ideas that are unique and appealing to your ideal audience. We created an entire blog post on generating content ideas , but a simple framework you can use to consistently curate interesting content ideas is this: What is the pain point our ideal customer faces that our product solves? This question ensures you are discussing the right topic, and if you’re doing SEO, it’s essential for your keyword research process. What is the “best practice” advice on solving that pain point, and why isn’t it working for our reader? This will help you develop an interesting angle that stands out from the rest of the “me-too” content. What is a better and more effective method to solve that problem, and what evidence/personal experience do we have to support that idea? With the rise of AI writers flooding social platforms with “me-too” content, thought leadership content with a unique and contrarian viewpoint will continue to stand out, and you’ll actually find it easier to build an audience. So before you publish any content, ask: Does this idea already exist in the market? Is this advice truly the best method to solve this problem? If you can’t authentically say “yes” to both of those questions, don’t publish the content. If you consistently publish content with an authentic brand voice and don’t regurgitate the same ideas that have already been published, you’ll gain trust much more quickly, as people will look to you as an industry leader. Step 4: Create a Content Calendar and Workflow Your content marketing strategy will only scale if you publish new content consistently. In fact, the formula for a great content marketing strategy is pretty simple: If you do these three things, you’ll find that your content marketing strategy is highly effective. The problem is that most people give up too quickly or don’t publish consistently. As a result, the audience you build forgets about your content and you’ll have to restart the relationship from zero. The good news is that implementing a simple content calendar and workflow process can reduce inconsistencies. To get started, adopt a project management platform, like Trello , Basecamp , or Asana , and then break down each content marketing campaign into various tasks that you can assign to your marketing team members with due dates. Here’s a great sample editorial calendar in Trello: Once you’ve created a workflow process, it’s pretty easy to then ensure each piece of content is published consistently. Step 5: Test And Measure Results The final step is to measure your results. This is tricky as content marketing is a long-term play, and you probably won’t see any immediate returns on your investment. However, some early content marketing metrics you can track to make sure your strategy is heading in the right direction include: Your sales team is generating higher quality leads that close faster Your general brand awareness has increased (more social media mentions, backlinks, brand queries, etc.) Your website is driving more traffic Your existing customers are staying longer and are generally happier In addition to tracking these general brand KPIs, be sure to also track specific campaigns so that you can assess what content performed the best and double down on producing more of those content formats and ideas. Most marketers track the majority of their content marketing efforts in Google Analytics, though you can also use third-party tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs to measure these metrics. Content Marketing Tips The content marketing strategy established above is the process you need to get an effective content marketing program off the ground. Once you have established systems and processes in place, here are a few more advanced content marketing tips to consider. Tip #1: Engage with your customers Audience research is important, but instead of just observing them from afar, interact with potential customers to learn more about their pain points and build genuine relationships. You can do this by joining Slack groups, Facebook groups, and other online communities to learn about the pain points these people face. For example, if you sell to Airbnb hosts, this might be a great community to join. While you shouldn’t sell your products or services in these groups, you can answer questions and use members’ questions as inspiration for new content ideas. Tip #2: Tastefully pitch your brand While content marketing should educate potential customers, it also does need to sell them at some point – otherwise it won’t be a profitable marketing strategy. The good news is that there is a way to tastefully pitch your product or service. Here’s an excellent example. This blog post targets the keyword “how to create an online course” and the brand that published this blog post, LearnWorlds, is an online course platform. As you can see, one of the steps is learning where to host your course. They first provide several options such as self hosting and online course marketplaces: Then, they provide a third option, which is using an online course platform like LearnWorlds. Then, they explain how it works and specific features that you should know about. For someone executing the steps of creating an online course, this is helpful information and can drive conversions for the brand. The key to tastefully pitching your product/service is: Ensure your product/service is genuinely a good solution to the product the potential customer is researching. Offer several other options (usually a DIY method like self hosting) as alternatives before pitching your product/service. Tip #3: Repurpose your content Most businesses don’t have the capacity to produce unique content for YouTube, social media, the blog, and a podcast. The good news is that you don’t have to create unique content for each platform. Content repurposing allows you to take one piece of content and rework it into different platforms. For example, if you have a long form video, you can take clips from it to post on social media and hire a writer to rework the video transcript into a blog post. This is a great example of content repurposing from the Pilot Institute. They published this video: Then they converted it into a blog post: They also occasionally repurpose clips from their videos on Instagram : This allows you to reach more people as each potential customer has their own platform preferences. The key is to make sure that each piece of content is formatted to the platform. For example, hire a writer to rework the transcript into a blog post rather than just publishing it as a plain transcript. Additionally, you can see that the clips posted on Instagram from the Pilot Institute are well optimized for the Instagram platform as each one has subtitles and the clips themselves are cut well for social media with each scene only lasting a second or two. Tip #4: Capture each viewer Many content marketers are excellent at attracting their ideal audience, though far fewer know how to keep them engaged and eventually convert those visitors into customers. Unfortunately, if your customers never convert, your content marketing won’t be effective. To solve this problem, include a helpful resource, like a cheat sheet or a template that the audience can download. Then, ask for their email address in exchange for the free download. Once you have their email address, you can send them a nurture email sequence to continue remarketing to them and eventually convert them into a customer. HubSpot is a master at capturing leads. For example, they have a guide on conversion rate optimization and then offer a CTA to download a CRO planning kit: When you click on “Download the free planner,” they ask for your email address. Once they have your email, they can remarket to you through email and eventually convert you into a customer. Tip #5: Research your competitors’ advertising strategies We already mentioned that analyzing your competitors’ content marketing strategies is a great way to get a basic understanding of what types of content and topics resonate with your audience. However, a pro content marketing tip is to analyze your competitors’ ads and use them as inspiration for your organic content marketing strategy. Specifically, look at your competitors’ longest running ads as those are probably generating the most sales (otherwise, they would have stopped running them). To track your competitors ads, you can use a paid tool like Ahrefs and look at the keywords they’re paying to rank for. These are all excellent keywords to write SEO content for: You can also look at the Meta Ads library to analyze your competitors ads. It also tells you how long the ad has been running for, so take note of the ones that have been running the longest. LinkedIn also has an ads library you can use to track your competitors’ ads: Work with Experienced Pioneers in Content Marketing and SEO For the first time, we’re bringing the Copyblogger methodology to clients.

Case Study: Here’s how we help ADD.org reach 114,548 more people per month (in a hyper-competitive market)using content marketing . #2: Social Media Content Marketing Examples GoPro GoPro is one of very few companies that expertly leverages user-generated content. Rather than just creating content themselves, they consistently run social media contests where users can submit their own content recorded on a GoPro to win a new GoPro. This kind of content performs incredibly well because, rather than just sharing a branded post, contestants share their best social media content with the GoPro hashtag. As the content itself is already the creator’s very best work, it naturally earns tons of engagement, which multiplies the reach of the GoPro hashtag. Source While GoPro has an advantage as their audience is mostly creators, any brand can use the contest blueprint. Instead of asking contestants to share a branded post, ask them to create their own content. Justin Welsh B2B brands are beginning to realize that the best way to win on social media is to boost the executives’ presence. Justin Welsh is an excellent example of a B2B influencer who has amassed a substantial following by consistently publishing high quality content on Twitter and LinkedIn. In fact, he now has an entire course on his process and the heart of his strategy is: Create a unique viewpoint by combining two different, yet valuable skills. Publish consistently and then capture your audience in an email list. Even if you’re a member of the marketing team and trying to discover methods to level up the company’s brand awareness, building your own social media presence or the social media presence of executives is a great way to then communicate the brand’s messages to a loyal audience. #3: Video Content Marketing Examples Ocho Most B2B brands assume that creating a video content marketing strategy means you must produce YouTube video content. However, Ocho is an excellent example of a brand that creates full video courses for its customers. They also collaborate with other industry influencers to create adjacent courses. For example, they collaborated with angel investors, tax strategists, and other experts who then helped them promote the content. DFB Guide This is an interesting YouTube channel that covers everything you could possibly want to know about Disney. Unlike most consumer YouTube channels that show off the creator’s personal life, the host, AJ, never even shows her face on the channel and instead provides detailed descriptions of her experiences at various Disney restaurants, theme parks, and hotels. She even has a team of people who go to various Disney locations to try out different foods and rides and then report back to her to deliver authoritative content for the YouTube channel. It’s an outstanding collection of truly expert insider tips that you can’t find elsewhere, and it’s packaged in well-organized videos (there’s usually a list of tips or rankings for each topic covered) that she narrates. Source This is also a very scalable business model as she doesn’t have to personally show her face or test out the various theme park amenities herself. #4: Podcast Content Marketing Examples My First Million My First Million is a B2B podcast hosted by Sam Parr and Shaan Puri, both of whom have successfully built and sold multi-million dollar companies. However, the podcast is popular not just because they’re successful entrepreneurs, but because they deliver unique perspectives through entertaining stories that most people have never heard of before. With over 100,000 listeners, it’s one of the top business podcasts, but it’s actually owned by the HubSpot podcast network. So even if you’re a B2B brand, you can elevate some of your executives to start a podcast and then use the ad space to promote your own company. Girls Gotta Eat This is a popular consumer podcast about relationships and dating that has succeeded largely thanks to the host’s entertaining stories about their personal experiences. They also have interesting guests on the podcast, though it’s their raw authentic stories that seem to keep the audience hooked. So if you have a podcast and are talking to a consumer audience, the best way to build trust and remain entertaining is sharing your own personal stories and being vulnerable about past experiences and challenges. Danny Miranda The Danny Miranda Show is only a few years old, though Danny has interviewed some of the biggest content creators podcasters on the scene, including Gary Vaynerchuck, Alex Hormozi, and others. He also recently sat down with the team at Copyblogger to discuss how to grow a successful podcast . Copywriting For Content Marketers While video and audio content is on the rise, text based content is still very popular and is still critical for blog writing, email marketing, and even a lot of social media content. So while there is a difference between copywriting and content marketing , many copywriters are content marketers and it’s a valuable skill to acquire. Therefore, learning how to be a copywriter is one of the fastest and most effective ways to improve the results of your content marketing. It’s the difference between a reader getting bored or frantically sharing your content with everyone they know. There’s no way I’ll be able to cover everything you need to know about copywriting in this blog post. It’s simply too broad and deep of a topic. However, I can share some of the essential elements of good copy that you can use to start improving your content right away. Obsess over your headlines Good copywriters know that headline writing is important. Great writers obsess over their headlines. It’s the one thing that determines whether or not your content gets read. You could have the most incredible content in the world, but if your headline is boring or weak, it won’t matter. A good headline is clear, specific, and intriguing. It should both tell the reader what to expect while also teasing them about what’s inside. Your headline should also qualify your reader, meaning that it should attract your target audience. If it’s too vague, a reader will start reading — thinking that the article applies to them — only to discover it has nothing to do with them. They’ll feel tricked. This is critical. You aren’t just trying to get anyone and everyone to click to read your article. That becomes meaningless. You want the right person reading your article, someone who you know will get value from it. So spend the extra minutes, hours, even days getting your headline right. Write to someone specific Copywriting is all about understanding the emotional and psychological state of the reader. You have to be able to get inside their heads and join the conversation. One way to do this is to write to someone very specific. This could be an avatar of your ideal customer that you’ve created, or it could be a real person who fits the bill of your target audience. Either way, picture this person as you write. What do they struggle with? What are there experiences? How would you talk to them if you were sitting on the couch at a coffee shop together? Once you’re clear on that, write to them. Ignore all of your professionalism and grammar rules. Just write like you’re there at the coffee shop with them, or like you’re writing an email to them. Your writing will become more personal and you’ll form stronger connections with your readers, which is key to building a loyal audience . They will feel like you’re talking right to them because you are, to some extent. That’s the kind of writing your audience will read, share, and buy from. Keep it simple One of the cardinal sins of copywriting is too much complexity that makes your message confusing. Good copy is all about breaking things down so that your reader can easily and quickly understand what you’re talking about. This means not using complicated words, insider speak, technical jargon, and long, perfectly structured sentences. That’s like a death warrant for your copy. Instead, break up your sentences. State your point simply. Find the easiest, simplest way to say what you’re trying to say. Otherwise, your reader will have to work hard to sift through what you’re writing and get confused. As a result, they don’t do anything. They don’t read, they don’t share, they don’t buy, nothing. That’s not what you want. So keep your writing simple and to-the-point. Content Marketing Statistics Hopefully you can see the value of content marketing, but if you want some additional proof that it’s one of the most effective long term marketing strategies, here are some statistics. Is content marketing effective? Yes, content marketing is effective as about 62% of B2B buyers will read at least 3-7 pieces of content before they’ll agree to talk to a salesperson, making content marketing essential for your marketing funnel. How many brands invest in content marketing? About 73% of B2B marketers and 70% of B2C marketers incorporate content marketing into their overall digital marketing strategies. How much does content marketing cost? Content marketing costs range, but about 39% of companies spend between $1,000 and $5,000 per month on content marketing, 33% spend over $5,000 per month on content marketing, and about 27% spend less than $1,000 per month on content marketing. A recent study by SEMrush broke it down: 27% of companies spend less than $1,000 19% of companies spend $1,000-$3,000 20% of companies spend $3,000-$5,000 17% of companies spend $5,000-$10,000 10% of companies said they spend $10,000-$20,000 6% of companies said they spend over $20,000 In addition, most companies (69%) increased their content marketing budgets in 2023, while only 3% planned to decrease spend. Which social media platform is most popular? According to data from Statista, the most popular social media platform is Facebook, with over 2.9 billion monthly active users . YouTube is the second most popular social media platform with over 2.5 billion monthly active users . How many companies use social media marketing? Surveys show that about 93% of marketers worldwide use social media marketing in their business’s marketing strategy. How do companies promote their content? According to statistics from SEMrush , the most popular form of content promotion is publishing organic social media content (73%). Here’s a full breakdown of the most popular content promotion strategies: 73% post organically on social media (organic posting) 53% send emails 51% use paid social media ads 33% optimize for organic traffic 29% leverage sponsorships (webinars, events, etc.) 28% invest in PR 25% use influencer marketing 11% guest post How many companies use video marketing? Studies show that 91% of companies use video marketing in their marketing strategies, which is the highest it’s ever been! Do people still read blogs? Yes, about 77% of internet users still actively read blog content. How many companies use AI in content marketing? Statistics show that 61.4% of marketers have used AI in at least one of their marketing campaigns, and 44.4% have used AI to aid their content creation process. Source For those who are not yet using AI, a lack of understanding of AI (41.9%) was cited as the top reason for not incorporating it into their workflow. The Future of Content Marketing Paid costs continue to rise, and as targeting becomes less accurate due to privacy concerns, the ROI of paid ads will likely continue to decline. Therefore, it’s likely that more and more companies will invest in content marketing. In addition, the introduction of artificial intelligence, from AI content writing tools to AI video editing tools, has made it easier than ever before for any company to increase its content output. As the volume of content increases, B2B and B2C content consumers gravitate more toward content that reflects personal experiences and unique and original ideas. Therefore, it’s likely that individual content creators will be critical to any brand’s content marketing strategy over the next several years.

Sticking to tried-and-true tips and tactics will help maximize your time, efficiency, and output—it's worth a 5-minute read. Content marketing—it's like trying to stand out at a rock concert while everyone else is shouting just as loud as you are. With millions of blog posts, videos, and social media updates flooding the internet daily, how do you make sure your content cuts through the noise? Well, by following the latest-and-greatest content marketing best practices (of course). Plus, we've collected all the tips and tactics into a single (downloadable) content marketing best practices checklist. You can find it at the bottom of this post, but resist the urge to skip to the end—you'll get the most benefit from digging in top-down. What's the big deal with following best practices? Before we get into the content marketing best practices, let's get on the same page about why all this matters. Content marketing isn't too complicated, right? Create content, and people will come to consume it. Not quite. Take a look at these statistics: There are more than 600 million blogs on the internet. WordPress users post approximately 70 million new posts on the platform every month (and that's only one of many content management platforms). YouTube publishers upload 500 hours of video content to the platform every minute. Users post over 95 million photos and videos on Instagram each day. Mind-boggling, right? With all that new content emerging daily, how in the world will your audience find your content—and why should they? You have something special to share: something your audience needs. However, they'll never find it if you don't follow the content marketing best practices outlined below. Benefits of following content best practices Here are a few ways content marketing best practices help improve your overall content program: Eliminate waste: Without plans and processes, you'll likely waste time creating duplicate content and building content pieces that don't align with your overall marketing strategy. Avoid shiny object syndrome: It's easy to get distracted when creating digital marketing content—I received a dozen emails , text , and Slack notifications just while outlining this piece. However, not every distraction, emerging marketing channel, or content trend is worth your time. Sticking to the best practices will keep you on track and aligned with your content marketing strategy . This will also help you stop procrastinating and start getting real work done. Maximize efficiency: There are only so many hours in a day—juice them for all they're worth. When you follow these best practices, you cut out the fluff and stick to grounded principles. And that's a surefire strategy for maximum productivity. Think outside the box: Understanding the best practices unlocks creative freedom to break conventional rules and think outside the box. It's like when an author breaks traditional grammar rules and gets applauded for it (we're looking at you, “The Road”). Build routines: Workflows and templates will keep you on track and help you produce content at a faster pace. Establish routines: Revisiting best practices can help you identify bad habits and build new routines that serve you and your content better. 40 content marketing best practices in 2025 While these content marketing best practices aren't necessarily in order of importance, it’s best to follow them sequentially. Start at the top and work your way down. 1. Identify your target audience Content marketing starts with your audience. Start somewhere else, and you're destined to build amazing things that nobody wants—Cheetos lip balm, anyone? First, choose the buyer persona you want to target. Don't have that yet? Start with lead nurturing and the customer lifecycle . Your content strategies might target different audiences and buyer persona, and that's OK. Just ensure you have a specific reader in mind when writing an article. Take this blog post, for example. Twilio SendGrid caters to marketers and developers . However, developers don't care much about content marketing best practices—that's why I wrote this for you, marketers. 2. Map out your buyer's journey You likely have a fictional customer journey in mind for your customers: the customer reads your tweet, laughs, follows your brand, sees more content, then buys your product. In reality, it's rarely that straightforward (or linear). Customer journey mapping helps you learn the real path your buyers take, from becoming completely unaware to brand ambassadors of your products. Plus, customer journeys tend to follow the same stages: Awareness Consideration Purchase Retention Advocacy Understanding what each stage looks like for your customers will help you make optimizations to improve it. Don't have a customer journey yet? Follow our how-to guide to get started . 3. Build a content marketing strategy Without a well-defined content marketing strategy, you're just throwing darts at the board and hoping something sticks. While that can score you some short-term wins, it's not a recipe for long-term success. Successful content marketing campaigns start with a plan. You need a reliable, scalable strategy you can trust. And a solid content marketing plan ensures that every piece of content has a purpose and that every purpose aligns with a greater organizational goal. Read How to Create a Content Marketing Strategy in 11 Steps to start building your plan. 4. Form a world-class content marketing team Top-notch content requires a world-class team, so focus on building a flexible, resilient content marketing team. Find folks with a wide variety of specialties: Graphic design Video Top-of-funnel content Search engine optimization (SEO) Copywriting Long-form content Webinars Social media management Don't be afraid to find freelancers and contractors to supplement your content needs. They can be great at filling skill gaps or keeping up with fluctuating demand. 5. Determine key performance indicators (KPIs) From the get-go—not later—you need to decide what business goals will be crucial to your team. You can't do everything, so get hyper-focused on a handful of metrics you want to tackle: Lead generation Organic traffic Sign-ups Sales Awareness Ensure your content aligns with your marketing goals—not the other way around. For example, content teams often make the mistake of coming up with ""good ideas"" before creating goals. This leads to amazing content that nobody wants or results your business doesn't need (or care about). 6. Audit your existing content Before you start thinking of new content you want to create, take a look at your existing library. You'll likely find heaps of great articles, videos, and graphics that just need a bit of tender loving care to perform well. For example, you might find a 3,000-word blog post getting little-to-no traffic. Identify keywords it might rank for on page 2 or 3 of Google's search engine results pages (SERPs), and optimize it to try and rank for page 1. It'll take you 10% of the time of creating a new piece—and it’ll start ranking faster too. 7. Identify content gaps While auditing your existing content library, look for gaps. What potential topics have you not covered yet? Do competitors create content you don't have? Understanding your content gaps gives you an excellent place to start when researching new pieces. For example, do you lack how-to tutorials for your products? Do you need a starter video for the onboarding process? 8. Repurpose content You can likely repurpose every piece of content you create. Whether an article, video, or podcast, there are dozens of ways you can repurpose your content in different formats. Let's take a podcast, for example. Here are a few ways you could repurpose a podcast episode: Transcribe your podcast and publish it as a blog post Highlight the top takeaways and quotes and publish them as a blog post Create graphics with quotes from your podcast episode to publish on social media Film your podcast episodes and publish them as YouTube or Vimeo videos Create a roundup post highlighting your best podcast episodes Make an email series based on lessons from your podcast Highlight takeaways in a SlideShare or slide deck Turn a podcast episode into a webinar presentation Publish podcast quotes on your Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook stories Need more ways to repurpose content? We've got 20 of them. Check out 20 Simple Ways to Repurpose Content to Boost Your Traffic . 9. Remember SEO Every piece of content you create can be multipurpose. For example, you might create a product-focused blog post about a new feature you're releasing. That's fine—your current audience will love that. However, you'll likely need to optimize this piece for search engines if you ever want anyone outside your existing customers to learn about it. Get comfortable doing basic keyword research and finding your users' search queries. Basic SEO best practices can take your content the extra mile. 10. Create different types of content Sometimes, content teams get stuck in a rut of producing the same content, whether blog posts, guides, or social media campaigns. Think outside the box and branch out. There's a whole wide world of content opportunities —experiment every once in a while to see if something clicks. Here's a quick list of different content formats you could produce: Blog posts Guides E-books Podcasts Infographics Webinars White papers Email campaigns Videos PDFs Presentations Templates Calculators Tutorials Interviews Case studies 11. Build backlinks Your site's backlinks and domain authority will impact how well it ranks on SERPs. Fortunately, content creation and backlink building go hand in hand. Look for ways to use content to create high-quality backlinks. Here are a few content-creation strategies for building backlinks: Create skyscraper content: There's a lot of meh content on the internet. Create the best-of-the-best pieces on topics to rank high and earn links back to your content organically. Publish original research: Everyone loves hard facts and data. Instead of regurgitating statistics from around the internet, do your research. It doesn't need to pass any standard deviations or anything—it could be a customer survey on LinkedIn. Offer to guest post: Offer to publish content on other authority websites and partner pages in exchange for backlinks to your website. Use infographics: Provide publicly usable infographics and ask for people to link back to your website when they use them. 12. Create templates for success When you find something that works, scale it. For example, if you have a handful of articles that outperform all the rest (which is often the case), decipher any similarities and what makes them perform well. Do the articles follow a certain format? Does the writing center on specific topics? Once you find the keys to success, turn them into a replicable template . For example, you might discover listicles perform best on your website or find top-of-funnel ""what is"" content works best. Scale your successes and juice them for all you can. 13. Maintain a content calendar A content calendar (or even an editorial calendar) will keep your content production and publishing schedule on track. Managing handfuls of writers and projects simultaneously can get messy—especially if you don't use a task management system. Without a content calendar, you'll end up with some weeks where you publish an overwhelming amount of content and others that experience content droughts. You want consistency. A content calendar ensures every new piece of content gets the time and space it deserves. That means you might publish 1 piece every day or 2 a week. Use a content calendar to stick to whatever cadence you decide on. 14. Target customer pain points You want the content you create to solve problems. Think about questions your customers might have or issues your products help solve. Once you identify the pain point, solve it with content. Your solution might not always be the primary answer, and that's OK. For example, if you sell fitness equipment, you might create motivational content to inspire your community to work out. Or if you sell email services, you might create content marketing best practice articles to help your customers understand how email works together with content marketing. See what I did there? 15. Focus on creating valuable content Content teams get pressured to create, create, create. With a never-ending to-do list, getting pulled into the publish, publish, publish mindset is easy. However, it's vital to take a step back every once in a while and ask: ""Where's the value in this piece?"" ""Do my customers really need this piece of content?"" ""Could I spend my time on something more important?"" ""What would happen if I didn't publish this content?"" Questions like these will help you discover if your content is valuable or just busy work. 16. Watch your frequency Frequency isn't so much about quality over quantity (though we'll get into that soon). It’s more about how often you publish on different channels. More (even if it's quality) isn't always better. For example, your customers might love your monthly email newsletter, but that doesn't mean they'd love it more as a weekly newsletter. The same goes with any medium. Just because you can publish a YouTube video every day doesn't mean you should. Your audience leads busy lives. They have work, family, and personal ambitions to go after. Keep that in mind when you produce content. Don't overwhelm your customers to the point where they can't consume all your content (even if they want to). 17. Get permission Believe it or not, not everyone wants to consume your content. Shocking, right? Yet, they won't always get to choose, especially when you use traditional media, video advertisements, or pay-per-click ads to get in front of them. However, on channels they do get to choose, ensure you get permission before marketing to them. For example, email and SMS are opt-in marketing channels. Just because you have your customer's email address from a purchase order or delivery update request doesn't mean you have permission to send them marketing messages. They need to give you "" unambiguous consent ."" Follow these opt-in options to learn more about getting subscribers (the right way). Also, brush up on General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws to ensure your email program is compliant. 18. Stay up to date on trends and algorithm changes Content marketing is an ever-changing field. Trends come and go, algorithms change, and new channels flare up and perish months later. It's up to you to stay on top of things to capitalize on shifts. I remember when I started listening to podcasts about 8 years ago. Even then, I thought I had already missed the podcast bandwagon—and look where we are now. 19. Experiment with new channels Even if it doesn't go according to plan, don’t be afraid to try a new tactic and channel—it's a learning experience. Plus, it's a solid excuse to secure your brand's name and tag on possible digital channels. You might think a channel might not align with your brand, but you'd be surprised. Just about any company can find success on platforms ranging from Instagram to TikTok to Reddit. There's a good chance your audience uses these different platforms, and that means there's an opportunity for you to reach them there. The challenge comes from creating relevant content for each channel that your audience wants . That's no small feat (and definitely beyond the scope of this article). Here are a few channels to consider experimenting with (if you haven't already): Email Social media Medium LinkedIn Reddit TikTok Quora SMS Public relations Myspace (yes, it still exists) 20. Improve the user experience Good content doesn't get the love it deserves if the user experience (UX) suffers. Everything from your site's user interface (UI) to the page's color scheme to accessibility concerns can impact the user experience, and it's a shame when these elements destroy quality content. Work with your UI/UX team to improve these factors on your website. Test how different layouts affect bounce rates and completion rates. Then, keep working to improve your content's experience to increase the likelihood that customers consume, enjoy, and share it. 21. Focus on quality over quantity I told you we'd get here eventually. When it comes to content, quality is always better than quantity. Often, you don't need 5 small blog posts—you just need one big comprehensive one. The same is true for almost all content you produce. Don't worry about how much of it you create—instead, measure each piece's impact. Push back against management if they set content creation goals. Content creation isn't your end goal—it's results. And who cares if you drive results with 3 videos or 15 videos? 22. Embrace trends (but show equal love to evergreen content) While it’s cool to jump on new trends, never forget about evergreen content. Evergreen content is always relevant. It might not get increased attention or features in headlines, but it's something your audience will always want. Let's look at email, for example. Right now, everyone cares about artificial intelligence (AI) assisting with email creation. That's fine and relevant, but do you know what email marketers will always search for? Tips for staying out of the spam folder Email subject line best practices Email design best practices Interest in topics like AI-based email marketing and Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) will rise and fall, but evergreen topics will always be important to your community. 23. Combine content types You can stretch the life of every piece of content you produce by looking for ways to combine it with other content types. For example, you might mix and match your content by adding a video to a blog post or using a new e-book in a webinar presentation. 24. Back everything up with data It’s always best not to make claims unless you can back them up with data. For example, I can't just say email marketing is the best distribution channel without also including a statistic like, ""Email marketing produces a high return on investment with a $38 return on every dollar spent ."" Look for any claims you make in your writing, and find data to support them. Dig deep down the research rabbit hole to ensure it's an accurate, legit statistic and not a regurgitated hoax without any original research. 25. Tie every piece of content to a specific goal Ideally, before you create it, connect every piece of content to a specific business goal. Will this content drive traffic or help build leads? Do we want this content to build brand awareness or drive sales? If you can't find a business goal to support your desired content, put it in the backlog. You might find a purpose for that content idea later, but stick with content creation that supports your immediate KPIs and metrics. 26. Use (don't abuse) AI AI writers and graphic generators are emerging. These tools can help create original content, build outlines, answer questions, and write articles. However, these are still in the infancy stage, and you should avoid over-relying on them. Don't be afraid to use AI—just don't abuse it. Let it inspire and give you ideas, but don't think it can replace your content marketing team. It can't. Need ideas for using AI? Try these AI-based email marketing use cases . 27. Collaborate with other teams It's easy for your content marketing team to become a silo. With so much going on and never-ending demand for content, collaboration often gets pushed aside. Think of teams you could partner with to bolster your effective content marketing efforts. For example, you might work with product marketing or sales to identify content to support their needs or get help from your developers to write more technical-focused content. 28. Redirect or delete content when necessary Old content can start to pile up. While often a vanity metric, lots of underperforming, outdated content just takes up space and accumulates cobwebs. If you can’t revive, optimize, or repurpose a piece, it's time to get rid of it. It'll be hard. You might tear up a bit, and that's OK. If you can't do it yourself, work with a partner who can identify content pieces that need to go objectively. You can do this. We believe in you. 29. Follow the 80/20 content distribution rule The 80/20 content rule suggests you spend: 20% of your time creating content 80% of your time promoting and distributing content When you publish new content, give it the promotional love it deserves. Just because you post something doesn't mean your audience will read or watch it—they likely won't know it exists. Use the following promotional channels to distribute every piece of content you produce better: Email Social media Display ads Internal linking Webinars Content bundles Podcast notes Quora Video descriptions 30. Make your content accessible Around 1.3 billion people live with some visual impairment—that could be a massive part of your audience. And even if it's not, creating accessible content is just the right thing to do. Think about accessibility design best practices , and ensure you add the small touches that make your content widely consumable. For example, add descriptive alt text to your images, and consider providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation online when hosting virtual events . 31. Optimize for voice search ""Hey Alexa, how do I optimize my content for voice search?"" Voice search isn't just coming...it's already here, and it's changing how people find your content. With smart speakers in millions of homes and voice assistants built into virtually every smartphone, optimizing for voice search isn't negotiable anymore. Voice searches are fundamentally different from typed queries. They're conversational, question-based, and typically longer. When someone types, they might search ""best email marketing platform."" But when they speak, it becomes ""What's the best email marketing platform for small businesses?"" Here's how to make your content voice-search friendly: Think in questions: Structure content around the actual questions your audience asks—Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. Get conversational: Write like you talk (but still professional)—voice searches use natural language. Target long-tail keywords: Voice searches are typically 3-5 words longer than text searches. Create structured FAQ sections: These directly answer common voice queries and are perfect for featured snippets. Consider local intent: Many voice searches have local intent (""near me"" queries), so include geographic terms if relevant. Focus on featured snippets: Voice assistants often pull answers from position zero—those coveted featured snippets at the top of search results. 32. Focus on interactivity Gone are the days when content was just a one-way street. Static content? Boring. Today's audience doesn't want to just read your stuff. They want to play with it, manipulate it, and make it their own. Interactive content flat-out performs better. Quizzes, calculators, polls, and interactive infographics don't just capture attention; they hold it hostage (in the best possible way, of course). Think about it: Which would you rather consume: a 2,000-word article about email deliverability rates or an interactive tool that analyzes your specific sending patterns and gives you personalized recommendations? Yeah, me too. Create calulators, add quizzes, ask for feedback, enable comments, incorporate sliders and toggles. This is where you go all in on whozits, whatzsits, and thingamabobs. 33. Clean up (read: delete) blog posts Your blog has some deadweight. It doesn't take an SEO expert or outside consultant to see that. Don't panic, though. You're not alone. We all get to that point sometimes, and it's okay. Well, as long as you do something about it, that is. For example, we've deleted, archived, and redirected hundreds of blog posts over the last year or so (and we plan to do a lot more). Yes, the vanity metric of number of posts surely takes a hit, but you know what doesn't? Our traffic. Now, you know those posts: the ones gathering digital dust in the corners of your site, bringing down your averages, and making Google question your content quality. It's time for some tough love. By removing underperforming content, you're actually helping your best stuff rank higher. Think of it like thinning out seedlings to let the strongest plants thrive. The 80/20 rule applies perfectly here: roughly 20% of your content likely drives 80% of your traffic. The rest? It's just taking up space and diluting your site's authority. Ouch, but true. We get it. Getting over your emotional attachment to content you worked hard to create. That post from 2019 about email trends might have been your baby, but if it's getting two visits a month and contains outdated advice, it's time to let it go. 34. Consider the entire funnel Your content strategy has a serious middle-child syndrome. Let me guess: tons of top-of-funnel awareness pieces, a decent chunk of bottom-funnel conversion content, but that middle section? Crickets. You're not alone. Most content marketers are addicted to vanity metrics like page views (hello, top-of-funnel) or obsessed with conversion rates (bottom-funnel), leaving the critical consideration stage abandoned like a shopping cart on a discount website. Your audience isn't ready to buy after reading one ""what is"" blog post, and that case study isn't going to magically appear in front of someone who doesn't know they have a problem. The content journey is real, folks. Your funnel needs content at every stage: Top-of-funnel: Yes, keep your educational blog posts, thought leadership, and trend reports—they build awareness. Middle-of-funnel: This is your secret weapon—comparison guides, detailed how-tos, expert interviews, and product tours that help prospects evaluate options. Bottom-of-funnel: Customer stories, detailed pricing content, implementation guides, and ROI calculators that seal the deal. Post-purchase: Onboarding content, advanced usage guides, and community resources that prevent churn and create advocates. Unfortunately, here's where most companies mess up: they create these pieces in isolation, with no clear path from one stage to the next. You need deliberate content pathways that guide readers logically through the buyer's journey. Think of it like a Netflix series—each episode should leave viewers wanting the next one. Your awareness piece should naturally lead to consideration content, which should make the case for conversion content. 35. Start using generative AI You're either using AI tools for content creation or you're falling behind. There's no middle ground anymore. The initial response to AI was predictable: ""But it can't match human creativity!"" True...and also completely missing the point. AI isn't meant to replace your creative process—it's meant to accelerate it, handle the grunt work, and let your team focus on what humans do best: strategic thinking and emotional connection. The key is finding the right human-AI balance. The best content teams use AI as a superpower, not a replacement. They feed the AI their brand voice guidelines, provide specific prompts with context, and then edit the output with their human expertise. The quality gap between AI early adopters and laggards is widening faster than most marketing leaders realize. Yes, there are ethical considerations. Yes, you should disclose AI usage when appropriate. And yes, you should have clear guidelines about fact-checking and quality control. But sitting on the sidelines isn't an option anymore. 36. Add content governance frameworks Remember when your content operation was just you and a WordPress login? Those were simpler times. Now you've likely got freelancers, agencies, subject matter experts, and that intern who keeps publishing things without approval. Content chaos isn't just annoying—it's expensive. Without proper governance, you're practically begging for inconsistent messaging, compliance nightmares, and the inevitable ""who approved THAT?"" moment during the executive review. Think of content governance as the guardrails that keep your content machine from driving off a cliff. It's not about bureaucracy. It's about creating systems that scale without sacrificing quality. Here's what a solid content governance framework looks like: Clear roles and permissions: Who can create, edit, approve, and publish? Document this before someone publishes the unfinished draft with placeholder text that reads ""INSERT LEGAL DISCLAIMER HERE."" Standardized workflows: Map out exactly how content moves from idea to publication, with defined checkpoints for SEO, legal, brand, and subject matter expert reviews. Brand and style guidelines: Create a living style guide that evolves with your brand but maintains consistency across channels and creators. Content auditing protocols: Establish regular reviews of existing content to identify update needs, consolidation opportunities, and retirement candidates. Compliance documentation: Track who approved what and when—your legal team will thank you when that random blog post from three years ago suddenly becomes relevant in a dispute. Emergency protocols: Define exactly who can publish what during a crisis, because that's not the time to be figuring out approval chains. 37. Test out micro-content strategies Not everyone has time for your 3,000-word epic guides. There, I said it. Speaking of which, this post is getting kind of long, isn't it? Huh. We're living in the TikTok era, where attention spans are measured in seconds, not minutes. And while there's absolutely still a place for comprehensive content, ignoring micro-content is like ignoring that half your audience is scrolling on their phones during meetings. Micro-content isn't just ""short content""—it's strategically bite-sized pieces designed for immediate consumption and high shareability. Think of it as content snacking between the full meals of your longer pieces. It fits perfectly into the gaps of your audience's day—the elevator ride, the coffee line, the three minutes before a meeting starts. When someone doesn't have time for your 45-minute webinar, they might still have time for your 60-second tip video. Plus, micro-content is content marketing on easy mode. That statistic that took you hours to research? Turn it into a shareable graphic. That key insight buried on page 12 of your whitepaper? Make it a standalone social post. 38. Lean into user-generated content (UGC) Your customers are creating content about your brand whether you like it or not. The question is: are you going to leverage it or ignore it? User-generated content isn't just free material—it's authentic social proof that outperforms your polished marketing copy every single time. When Nielsen reports that 92% of consumers trust peer recommendations over advertising, they're basically telling you to stop talking and let your customers do it for you. The smartest brands don't just collect UGC: they actively shape it by providing creative frameworks. Starbucks' White Cup Contest didn't just ask for random photos. It gave clear parameters that resulted in on-brand artistic expressions. UGC creates a virtuous cycle. When customers see you featuring their peers, they're more likely to contribute their own content, creating a sustainable ecosystem of authentic marketing material. 39. Localize your content That ""universally appealing"" content you're so proud of? It's probably alienating half your global audience. True content localization goes way beyond running your blog posts through Google Translate and calling it a day. It's about recognizing that different markets have fundamentally different needs, references, pain points, and cultural contexts. When your American case study references baseball metaphors and Super Bowl ads, you're losing your international audience faster than you can say ""cultural imperialism,"" (and that's a mouthful already). Localization isn't just for enterprise companies. Even if you're a small business, your digital content reaches global audiences. Google Analytics probably shows international traffic you're not effectively serving. Start small if needed. Identify your top international markets and localize your highest-performing content first. Then expand as you see results. Just please, for the love of global commerce, stop assuming everyone gets your references to ""American as apple pie"" or understands your payment processor that only works with US banks. 40. Beat the SEO research By the time a keyword shows decent volume in Ahrefs or SEMrush, you're already too late to the party. The competition has arrived, the difficulty has spiked, and you're fighting an uphill battle for rankings. Elite content marketers don't chase keywords—they predict them. They identify emerging topics before they hit the research tools and establish authority while everyone else is still wondering if there's an opportunity. The content teams that master this approach build massive authority while competitors are still waiting for ""sufficient search volume"" to justify creating content. By the time everyone else jumps on the trend, you're already ranking #1 with established backlinks and engagement signals. Take ""conversational commerce"" as an example. Brands that created definitive content when it was just a concept mentioned at tech conferences dominated the SERP by the time it became a high-volume search term. This approach requires confidence and strategic risk-taking. You'll occasionally invest in topics that never take off. But when you're right (which you will be if you're truly connected to your industry), the payoff is fantastic.

By Download this guide as a PDF -> What is Machine Learning? Machine learning is a branch of computer science that allows computers to automatically infer patterns from data without being explicitly told what these patterns are. These inferences are often based on using algorithms to automatically examine the statistical properties of the data and creating mathematical models to represent the relationship between different quantities. Let's contrast this with traditional computing, which relies on deterministic systems, wherein we explicitly tell the computer a set of rules to perform a specific task. This method of programming computers is referred to as being rules-based. Where machine learning differs from and supersedes, rules-based programming is that it's capable of inferring these rules on its own. Say you're a bank manager, and you'd like to figure out whether a loan applicant is likely to default on their loan. In a rules-based approach, the bank manager (or other experts) would explicitly tell the computer that if the applicant's credit score is less than a threshold, reject the application. A machine learning algorithm, however, would simply take in historical data on the credit scores of customers and their loan outcomes and figure out, on its own , what this threshold should be. In doing so, the machine is learning from historical data and creating its own rules . This is just an introduction to machine learning, of course, as real-world machine learning models are generally far more complex than a simple threshold. Still, it's a great example of just how powerful machine learning can be. Any organizational KPI can be optimized as long as you have the relevant data. Given a historical customer dataset, for example, you could predict which of your current customers are in danger of leaving, so you can stop churn before it happens. Modern approaches to machine learning have made great strides and can accomplish a lot more than just that. From self-driving cars to voice recognition to the automated email filtering systems that flag the spam in your inbox, machine learning algorithms form the basis of many of the advances in technology that we've come to depend on today. Next, let's consider the different types of machine learning algorithms and the specific types of problems they can solve. Types of Machine Learning Machine learning algorithms are often divided into three general categories (though other classification schemes are also used): supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised Learning Supervised machine learning refers to classes of algorithms where the machine learning model is given a set of data with explicit labels for the quantity we're interested in (this quantity is often referred to as the response or target). Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to train AI models. If youâre dealing with unlabeled data, youâll need to do data labeling. Labeling is the process of annotating examples to help the training of a machine learning model. Labeling is typically performed by humans, which can be expensive and time-consuming. However, there are ways to automate the labeling process. A great example of supervised learning is the loan applications scenario we considered earlier. Here, we had historical data about past loan applicants' credit scores (and potentially income levels, age, etc.) alongside explicit labels which told us if the person in question defaulted on their loan or not. Supervised learning algorithms can be further subdivided into regression and classification . This difference refers to the type of quantity our target is. If the target is a choice between a few discrete categories â for example, will the applicant default or not, is this a picture of a cat, a dog, or a human, etc. â then the problem is referred to as classification , as we're trying to determine the class that a given data point belongs to. If, however, our target variable is continuous, then the problem is referred to as regression . For example, predicting the price of a house given the number of bedrooms and its location. Unsupervised Learning In unsupervised learning problems, the data we're given has no labels, and we're simply looking for patterns. For example, say you're Amazon. Given customers' purchase history, can we identify any clusters (groups of similar customers)? In this scenario, even though we don't have explicit, definitive data on what a person's interests are, just identifying that a particular group of customers purchase similar items can allow us to make purchase recommendations based on what other people in the cluster have also purchased. Similar systems are what power Amazon's ""you might also be interested in"" carousel. K-means clustering is a type of clustering model that takes the different groups of customers and assigns them to various clusters, or groups, based on similarities in their behavior patterns. On a technical level, it works by finding the centroid for each cluster, which is then used as the initial mean for the cluster. New customers are then assigned to clusters based on their similarity to other members of that cluster. Additionally, once we've identified the clusters, we could then study their characteristics. For example, suppose we see that a given cluster is buying many video games. In that case, we can make an educated guess that this group of customers are gamers, even though no one actually told us so. Once we've done this form of analysis, we could potentially even use the labels from unsupervised learning to create supervised learning models that may, for example, allow us to predict how much money a 25-year-old gamer is likely to spend with us compared to a 50-year-old fishing enthusiast. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is a class of machine learning algorithms where we assign a computer agent to perform some task without giving it much guidance on precisely what to do. Instead, the computer is allowed to make its own choices and, depending on whether those choices lead to the outcome we want or not, we assign penalties and rewards. We repeat this process multiple times, allowing the computer to learn the optimal way of doing something by trial and error and repeated iterations. Think of this as the carrot-and-stick approach to machine learning. It's almost like the computer is playing a video game and discovering what works and what doesn't. Interestingly, playing games is precisely the application where reinforcement learning has shown the most astonishing results. Google's infamous AlphaGo model, which trounced even the highest-ranked human players of Go, was built using reinforcement learning. Google has since extended the same technology to AlphaZero, a successor to the original AlphaGo used as a reference by chess players to determine the best strategies. Deep Learning If you've seen machine learning in the news, you almost certainly have also heard about deep learning. And you might be wondering at this point where deep learning fits into the above paradigm. And the answer is all of them. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that breaks a problem down into several 'layers' of 'neurons.' These neurons are very loosely modeled on how neurons in the human brain work. This class of machine learning is referred to as deep learning because the typical artificial neural network (the collection of all the layers of neurons) often contains many layers. While deep learning was initially used for supervised learning problems, recent advances have extended its capabilities to unsupervised and reinforcement learning problems. And they have shown tremendous results. Many of the latest advances in computer vision, which self-driving cars and facial recognition systems depend on, are rooted in the use of deep learning models. Natural language processing, which allows computers to understand natural human conversations and powers Siri and Google Assistant, also owes its success to deep learning. Today's AI boom is largely thanks to the pioneers of deep learning: Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio. These AI engineers were awarded the Turing Award for their breakthrough advancements in deep neural networks. What is the Difference Between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? If you've ever looked at a tech company's website or watched the keynote for Apple's latest iPhones, you might have seen terms like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) popping up everywhere. These ""buzzwords"" are often treated interchangeably, though there are subtle and important differences between them. So, let's look at what both of these terms imply, exactly, and how they all relate to each other. To start off, let's first define each of these terms and then circle back to the question of how they're related. What is Artificial Intelligence? While it's possible to write a book on AI covering computer science, history, philosophy, and the very nature of intelligence, let's keep things simple. The easiest and most accessible way of defining artificial intelligence is simply looking at the words: it's an attempt to create intelligence. The discipline of AI studies the theory and practice of intelligent systems, especially automated decision making and learning.Â In less abstract terms, it's an attempt at allowing computers to mimic both humans' perception of the world as well as our ability to reason with it. That is a tall order, of course, but it sums up the ultimate goal of AI research rather well. Consider the Terminator. This was an imaginary machine perfectly capable of navigating our world, incorporating new information about its surroundings and the very dynamic nature of both the world and its inhabitants, and making independent decisions without needing any instructions from a human. This definition also makes it abundantly clear that we are a long, long way away from achieving true artificial intelligence. Still, the contributions of todayâs AI are almost limitless. The benefits of AI are already being felt in many industries, including medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, or simply sales and marketing. AI is changing the way we work, play, and engage with one another, from the tools we use to the ways we communicate to the organizations we form. The Three Types of Artificial Intelligence But while a genuinely independent machine perfectly capable of handling itself in all situations is the holy grail of research in this field, we have already made significant progress in allowing computers to exhibit human-like capability when performing at least very specific tasks. To distinguish between these different levels of intelligence, researchers in the field often divided artificial intelligence into two or three types: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) ANI is often referred to as weak AI , as it is designed to exhibit ""intelligence"" or human-like ability in performing a specific task. One of the next frontiers in ANI is maximizing the efficiency of models. This includes optimizing training, inference, and deployment, as well as enhancing the performance of each. AGI or strong AI refers to systems that are capable of matching human intelligence in general (i.e., in more than a few specific tasks), while an artificial super intelligence would be able to surpass human capabilities. For now, these comparisons are largely relegated to schools of thought, as all deployed AI models are examples of Artificial Narrow Intelligence (not AGI or ASI). There are a number of factors that are accelerating the emergence of AGI, including the increasing availability of data, the development of better algorithms, and progress in computer processing. The AI in the movie ""Her"" is a cultural example of an AGI. Samantha, the artificial intelligence character in the movie, has her own thoughts and opinions. She's not a subservient robot, but rather an independent being. Samantha is capable of using voice and speech recognition, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. These are good examples of artificial narrow intelligence, as they show a machine performing a single task really well. However, the beauty of general AI is that it's capable of integrating all of these individual elements into a single, holistic system that can do everything a human can. And while we haven't achieved the latter, we have achieved remarkable progress with the former. Consider self-driving cars, for example. They're an example of ANI, as they excel at a specific task (navigation), and are generally quite capable of identifying elements in their environment (other cars, pedestrians, etc.) and incorporating that information into a decision (e.g., how to make a turn or when to use the brakes to avoid a collision). Virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are examples of the great strides we've made in creating robust ANI systems that are capable of creating actual value for businesses and individuals. These assistants use speech recognition, an AI-enabled technology that allows an individual to input voice commands and receive a response. This is achieved through a machine learning model which learns and understands the structure of language by processing sound waves. In any AI system, data is collected and processed in order to make predictions. This data is then cleaned and converted into a format that can be used by the model. The model will then generate a prediction, which can be viewed as a response to some input. The input may be a question or task, and the response can be considered an answer or a solution. Other examples include facial and image recognition systems, speech-to-text, machine translation (Google Translate), and recommendation engines (how Amazon or Netflix know which products you'd like). And this is also where machine learning comes in, as the majority of these advances have been made possible thanks to machine learning (and deep learning). Whether or not AGI emerges, AI of the future will be embedded everywhere and will touch every part of society, from smart devices to loan applications to phone apps. With the rapid growth of AI, practically all industries are exploring how they can take advantage of this new technology. What is Machine Learning? As we discussed in this guide's introduction, ""machine learning is a branch of computer science that allows computers to automatically infer patterns from data without being explicitly told what these patterns are. "" As such, machine learning is one way for us to achieve artificial intelligence â i.e., systems capable of making independent, human-like decisions. Unfortunately, these systems have, thus far, been restricted to only specific tasks and are therefore examples of narrow AI. In the last two decades, many of the most exciting machine learning applications have come from a subset of the field referred to as Deep Learning . As discussed in the deep learning section of this guide, deep learning algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image recognition and natural language processing problems. They have also shown incredible promise in forecasting and reinforcement learning problems. Let's circle back and look at how AI, ML, and DL relate to each other. How are AI and ML Related? The following graphic explains the relationship between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning rather well. AI is the most general of the three and could almost be thought of as the overarching goal of this field of research: creating systems capable of mimicking human decision making. A common misconception is that AI is learning. In reality, AI is programmed by humans to complete tasks and offer predictions. AI can mimic intelligence, but it cannot independently learn like a person. The goal of AI engineers today is to make machines think more like humans and less like machines. Another goal of AI researchers today is to make AI behave more like humans. This is particularly challenging, as behavior is thought of as the joint product of predisposition and environment, which are entirely different concepts between people and machines. Machine learning is one way of achieving artificial intelligence, while deep learning is a subset of machine learning algorithms which have shown the most promise in dealing with problems involving unstructured data, such as image recognition and natural language. Machine learning is commonly used as a part of hybrid systems. Hybrid systems are a mix of human and machine intelligence that seeks to combine the best of both worlds, such as machine learning models that send predictions to humans to be analyzed. It is important to distinguish between machine learning and AI, however, because machine learning is not the only means for us to create artificially intelligent systems â just the most successful thus far . Symbolic AI In the early years of research into this field, for example, researchers focused on building Symbolic AI systems â also referred to as classical AI or good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI) .Â This approach to creating intelligent systems focuses on representing the world as a collection of symbols, translating real-world problems into symbolic propositions, and then allowing the computer to use propositional logic to solve these problems. These efforts were based on the observation that humans (and our languages) use symbols to represent both objects in the real world and how they relate to each other. ""John"" and ""pizza"" are symbols, while ""eat"" is the relationship between these two objects/symbols. Suppose we could represent the entire universe (or at least, all of the information pertaining to a specific domain, such as medicine) into such symbols and relations. In that case, a computer could then solve these problems using logic. We could also link different propositions together using if-then rules. For example, IF HUNGRY(John) THEN EAT(John, Pizza). This is an example of an extremely simple rule-based symbolic AI. Of course, while this simplistic example only uses a few symbols and a single rule, a real computer system can store billions of such symbols, propositions, and rules. Such rule-based systems formed the basis for what are known as expert systems , AI tools that rely on a hierarchy of rules to provide solutions to problems. For example, consider a doctor diagnosing a patient. These diagnoses are often also rule-based: i.e., if the patient has X and Y symptoms, if their blood sugar is greater than Z, then they have disease A. As a result, AI has had a big impact on cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Researchers have shown that algorithms are better than humans at classifying cells as cancerous or not. Or consider the loan application problem that we discussed in the machine learning article. A panel of experts could easily represent this problem into a series of symbols and rules (e.g., IF credit score > X AND loan amount < Y THEN approve the loan). This could then be used to create an AI expert system that could potentially replace a doctor or a loan officer for making these decisions. Symbolic AI enjoys several advantages over machine learning. While machine learning systems practice pattern recognition on historical data, symbolic systems only require an expert to define the problem space in terms of symbols, propositions, and rules. Thus, it requires next to no training data. Additionally, since symbolic AI systems comprise a hierarchy of human-readable rules, they're much easier to interpret than, say, deep neural networks, which are famously opaque and difficult to interpret. Lastly, an ideal symbolic AI, with all the knowledge of the world that a human possesses, could potentially be an example of an artificial general (or super) intelligence capable of genuinely reasoning like a human. With that said, while it theoretically makes sense to argue that we could potentially express all knowledge as symbols, the reality is that our understanding of the world is incredibly complex and explicitly stating all of human knowledge and common sense as a series of symbols and relations would be a Herculean task. Some pieces of information may also be difficult to represent as symbols. For example, consider image classification. How does one describe a '2' in image form as a symbol? While neural networks excel at these tasks, simply translating the problem into a symbolic system is difficult. This was one of the major limitations of symbolic AI research in the 70s and 80s. These systems were often considered brittle (i.e., unable to handle problems that were out of the norm), lacking common sense, and therefore ""toy"" solutions. These limitations were among the primary drivers of the first âAI winterâ, a period of time when most funding into AI systems was withdrawn, as research failed to satisfactorily address these problems. As a result, aside from some niche applications, symbolic AI has generally fallen out of fashion in favor of machine learning, which focused on specific tasks (i.e., narrow AI) but provided far more robust solutions. Advances in computing power and the proliferation of data in the internet era have also been a significant boosting factor in enabling machine learning systems, whose performance is often limited by the amount (and quality) of the data available to them. In recent years, however, researchers have started looking at combining machine learning systems, especially neural networks, with symbolic AI in an attempt to capitalize on the strengths of both these approaches to AI. This is referred to as neural-symbolic computing . ML Applications: Regression Many business applications require predicting a continuous quantity . For example, âwhat is the lifetime value of a customer with a given age and income level?â, or, âwhat is the probability of customer churn?â These are generally referred to as regression problems . In this article, we will go over several machine learning algorithms used for solving regression problems. While we wonât cover the math in depth, we will at least briefly touch on the general mathematical form of these models to provide you with a better understanding of the intuition behind these models. Linear Regression The most common method for solving regression problems is referred to as linear regression . Say youâre given the following data about the relationship between pH and Citric acid to determine wine quality. You can clearly see a linear relationship between the two, but as with all real data, there is also some noise. Since the relationship is linear, it makes sense to model this using a straight line. You might recall from high school math that the equation of a straight line is given as: whereÂ y is the response,Â x is the predictor,Â m is the slope of the line (or the coefficient/weight of x ), and c is the y-intercept We can extend this to multiple predictors as follows, which is also the general form of linear regression: where y^ is our modelâs prediction Î²â is the intercept Î²áµ¢ is the coefficient of the xáµ¢-th predictor, and p is the total number of predictors But we could potentially draw many straight lines and because of the noise, itâs not entirely clear which one is the âbest lineâ. For example, of the three lines below, which is the better one? This requires us to define a criterion for what is, mathematically, considered âgoodâ vs. âbad.â Since weâre using this model to predict quantities, it makes sense to use the error of our predictions as our yardstick, where the error is defined as the difference between the actual value and our prediction. A line that minimizes the overall prediction error is âgood,â while a line that has a large overall error is âbad.â There are different ways of calculating errors. For our purposes, weâll use the sum of squared errors (SSE) . As a simple example of this, consider the following example of predicting the weather: At this point, you might be wondering why weâre taking the square of the errors, and not just the actual value. Thatâs because we donât want negative and positive errors to cancel each other out. If we just summed the error values in the above example, weâd get 4 - 3 - 1 = 0. This would suggest the model is perfect and give us a false sense of confidence in our model. Using squared errors prevents this from happening. The mathematical formula below describes the aforementioned sum of squared errors. When using the sum of squared errors, itâs important to understand that this isnât a perfect indicator of how well a model fits the data, but itâs simple to understand, and thus widely used, as it relies on just three values: The number of data points, the actual values, and the predictions. where n the number of data points we have yáµ¢ is the actual value of the response for data point i yáµ¢ is our prediction for data point i Thus, of all the possible lines we can draw, we would select the line with the lowest SSE. This is referred to as an objective function â i.e., some value we want to either minimize or maximize. In this case, we want to minimize the SSE. While we wonât go into the mathematical details here, this problem can easily be solved using optimization theory , thereby allowing us to find the âbestâ line which minimizes the sum of squared errors. Once we have found the best-fit line, we can make predictions for any new input point by interpolating its value from the straight line. For example, while none of our data points have a citric acid of 0.8, we can predict that when citric acid value is 0.8, the pH is ~3. â While the above example was extremely simple with only one response and one predictor, we can easily extend the same logic to more complex problems involving higher dimensions (i.e., more predictors). Nonlinear Regression Methods Real-world regression problems are often nonlinear . There are many ways to deal with such problems, either by extending the linear regression model itself or using other modeling constructs. For example, say the data we have looks like this: While thereâs some noise, you can see that this resembles a quadratic curve. Letâs say we know that the true relationship is given by the equation: We could easily extend the linear regression model to this problem by simply taking the square of the dependent variable and adding it as another predictor for the linear regression model. We could do the same for higher-order terms, and this is referred to as polynomial regression . Other, more complex methods include the use of splines . While we wonât go into the theory or the math behind this in any detail, at a fundamental level, splines allow us to fit different nonlinear functions to different parts of the input space, while ensuring that the functions are smooth (i.e., connected) at the boundaries between these regions.Â The result is a highly flexible model that can fit nonlinear data more closely. However, this may come at the expense of overfitting as the model may be fitting to random noise instead of the actual patterns. As a result, splines and polynomial regression should be used with care and evaluated using cross-validation to ensure that the model we train can be generalized. We may also use nonparametric methods for regression problems. The simplest of these may just be K-nearest neighbor regression . In this method, given historical data and a new data point we want a prediction for, we simply find the k data points closest to this new point and predict its value to be the mean of these k points. We can also use decision trees for regression problems. Here, we split the data into different subsets based on a set of criteria. We may then assign a fixed value to each leaf node as its prediction (e.g., the mean of all the data points belonging to that leaf node). See the example below of using decision tree regression for predicting the number of hours played based on different weather conditions: Alternatively, we could also fit a separate linear regression model for each of the leaf nodes. As with many other machine learning problems, we can also use deep learning and neural networks to solve nonlinear regression problems. Predicting Probabilities with Logistic Regression Letâs extend the idea of predicting a continuous variable to probabilities. Say we wanted to predict the probability of a customer canceling their subscription to our service. Since probability is a continuous variable, it naturally extends itself to regression. However, itâs a continuous variable capped by two constraints: a probability can neither be negative nor greater than 1. Regular linear regression is incapable of abiding by these constraints, and thus the logistic model was born. Logistic regression is an extension of linear regression, which straddles the line between regression and classification. It works on the same principle as linear regression but with a key difference: the response is the natural log of the odds of an event occurring .Â Odds , in statistics, refers to the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring: For example, say the probability of Barcelona winning their next match is 30%. Then, the odds for their victory are 3/7 or 3:7. This is also the nomenclature used in gambling, though gambling sites often show odds against an event and not odds for. The odds against Barcelona, in this case, would be 7:3. The log of odds (or log-odds) is often referred to as logit(p) , where p is the probability of an event occurring. The logistic model is thus represented by the following equation: Statistically, the most salient aspect of using the natural log of odds is that while the output of the regression model is still unconstrained, when we convert the log odds back to probabilities, these are capped to between 0 and 1, thus solving our problem! While we wonât go into the mathematical details of why that is the case, you can see below a graph of the output probability p as the value of the independent variable changes: Thus, weâve successfully extended the linear regression model to predict probabilities. Once we have an estimate for the probability of an event occurring, classification is just one step away. If we set a certain probability as a threshold , we can classify each data point (e.g., each customer) into one of two classes. Choosing this threshold is largely dependent on the application.Â For example, a luxury carmaker that operates on high margins and low volumes may want to be highly proactive and personally check in with customers with even a 20% probability of churn. If churn is not mission-critical or we simply donât have the resources to handle individual customers, we may want to set this threshold much higher (e.g., 90%) so we are alerted to only the most urgent prospects. ML Applications: Classification In the previous section, we dealt with examples of regression problems , where we want to predict a continuous variable. The second major type of supervised learning problem is classification, where we want to assign each sample into one of two (or more) categories . For example, a bank may want to determine if a loan applicant will repay their loan or not. Or an email provider might want to build a system that filters out spam from your inbox.Â In both these cases, we have only two possible classes/categories, but itâs also possible to handle problems with multiple options. For example, a lead-scoring system might want to distinguish between hot, neutral, and cold leads. Computer vision problems are often also multi-class problems , as we wish to identify multiple types of objects (cars, people, traffic signs, etc.). In this article, weâll examine some of the algorithms used for classification problems. However, the focus here will be on building intuition, and so we wonât be covering the math behind these algorithms in any detail. Weâll also focus on only binary classification problems (i.e., those with only two options) for simplicity. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) One of the simplest classification algorithms is KNN classification . Say we have historical data with labels and a new point whose label we want to determine. In this method, we simply find the k points closest to the new point and assign its label to be the mode (the most commonly occurring class) of these k points. For example, consider the image below. If k=3 , then the label of the green point is a red triangle because, among the three points closest to it, the majority (â) are red triangles. As we discussed in the regression section , the KNN algorithm can also solve nonlinear regression problems. Support Vector Machines (SVM) Another commonly used classification algorithm is SVM. Consider the following example where we want to filter out spam emails. The x-axis is the number of times the word âbuyâ appears in the email, and the y-axis is the number of other people who have received the same email. When plotted, the data looks like this: The blue points are legitimate emails, and the red points are spam. Spam emails presumably want you to buy things and are sent to more people, so it makes sense that emails sent out to a large number of people with many mentions of the word âbuyâ are spam. More importantly, we see that we can clearly separate the two classes using a straight line, but as with linear regression, this raises the question: which line is the best? As shown below, we can draw many possible lines, all of which perfectly separate between the two classes. We may want to, thus, think about defining what makes one line better than another. This is somewhat dependent on the problem weâre trying to solve, and weâll revisit this point later on. For now, though, a reasonable criterion may be to choose the line which maximizes the margin between the two classes â that is, the line which is as far away as possible from the most extreme examples of either class.Â This raises another question: how can we translate this into a mathematical problem instead of just doing it by eye? Consider the following diagram: We can find the âbestâ line by first drawing two lines that only touch the outermost points of each class. Note also that both of these lines are parallel to each other. These lines are called support vectors ; hence the name of the algorithm. The âbestâ line is then a line that is parallel to both of these lines and also equidistant from them (i.e., itâs the same distance from each). The distance between the support vectors and the classifier line is called the margin , and we want to maximize this. This is the most common (or default) way in which SVM selects the best classifier line. This may not always be the ideal way of doing things, however. For example, say we were working on determining if a tumor is benign or malignant. In this case, the cost of making a mistake is not the same for each class. If we classify a malignant tumor as benign, it could potentially cost the patient their life, while mistaking a benign tumor as malignant might only require further testing. Clearly, one mistake is worse than the other. Depending on the application and how careful we want to be, we may choose to assign a greater weight to either type of mistake. As such, we may decide to move the line further away from one class or even deliberately mislabel some of the data points simply because we want to be extremely cautious about making a mistake. Next, letâs consider scenarios where the two classes cannot be cleanly separated via a straight line. Soft vs. Hard Classifiers Sometimes, it may not be possible to perfectly classify points using a straight line. We could, then, resort to nonlinear methods (discussed later), but for now, letâs stick to only straight lines. In that case, we may be willing to take an imperfect classifier. This is also called a soft classifier , as it does not classify all points correctly. On the other hand, a hard classifier would refer to the examples weâve discussed thus far, which perfectly classify all data points. Consider the following example: In the above image, we see that the soft classifier weâve selected misclassifies three points (highlighted in yellow). At the same time, we also see two blue points and two red points (circled in blue) that are extremely close to the line and are near-mistakes. Thus, our classifier has a very small margin between the two classes. Consider a second possible classifier we could draw for the same data: In this case, we have five misclassified points (compared to three before), but the line has a wider margin and very few points that are near-misses or extremely close to the line. This demonstrates an inherent tradeoff with soft classifiers. We can choose to either minimize errors or maximize the margin between the two classes.Â While we wonât show the mathematical details here, we can assign different weights to either of these options depending on how important higher accuracy is compared to having a cleaner, less ambiguous boundary.Â This is an example of a model hyperparameter : a variable that we specify for the algorithm and which defines or in some way constrains the form that our model will take. Nonlinear SVM Classifiers Now, consider the following example: In this case, we see that while a straight line cannot separate these points, a circle can. How can we solve this problem? As weâve seen above, one option may be to use nonlinear methods like KNN classification or classification trees.Â Since these are nonparametric methods and donât specify a particular form for the model (e.g., that it needs to be a straight line), they are particularly well-suited for nonlinear problems. However, SVM can also be extended to solving this problem by transforming the data to achieve linear separation between the classes. For example, we can see that all the points within a circle of radius 2 are red and those outside it are blue. In a simple case like this, if we convert the data from Cartesian to polar coordinates. The resulting plot is shown below, where the x-axis is the radial distance from the origin, and the y-axis is the angle in radians: As can be seen, the classes are now easily separated using a straight line. Thus, we would simply feed the SVM algorithm this transformed version of the data. In more complex scenarios, especially when we have multi-dimensional problems and donât know that the ideal classifier is, for example, a circle, we may not know which transformation to use. In other cases, the transformation may be computationally inefficient. In these cases, we can transform the problem by adding more dimensions to it. This is referred to as the kernel trick or Kernel SVM and allows us to create nonlinear classification boundaries like the one below: An explanation of the mechanics or the math of how and why kernel SVM works is beyond the scope of this article. Still, itâs an important detail to know in order for you to have a comprehensive understanding of the kinds of problems the SVM algorithm can solve. Kernel methods should be used with SVM with caution, however. By adding more dimensions to the problem and allowing for nonlinear boundaries, we are creating a more flexible model . This can easily lead to overfitting . Classification Trees Another means of solving classification problems â and one thatâs exceptionally well-suited to nonlinear problems â is the use of a decision tree .Â Since decision trees can be used for both classification and regression problems (see the regression section), the algorithm is sometimes referred to as CART (Classification and Regression Trees) . In this method, we divide the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on a series of binary (yes/no) questions. Consider the following decision tree for deciding if we should play football or not, based on how the weather affected past games: The balls at the leaf nodes indicate whether we were able to successfully finish a game (blue) with the given weather conditions or whether the game had to be interrupted due to poor weather (red). We see that on most rainy days with wind, we were forced to cancel our games. As such, the mode of this leaf node is red, and we would classify any future rainy and windy days as red (i.e., we probably shouldnât play on those days). Note that decision trees are also an excellent example of how machine learning methods differ from more traditional forms of AI. You might recall that in the What is the difference between machine learning and AI section, we discussed something called expert systems , which are a hierarchy of if/else rules that allow a computer to make a decision. A decision tree is also a hierarchy of binary rules, but the key difference between the two is that the rules in an expert system are defined by a human expert. On the other hand, decision trees figure out what the splitting criteria at stage (i.e., the rules) should be by themselves â which is why we say that the machine is learning . How does it do that? You might have noticed that each of the leaf nodes consists mostly of one class â for example, the Sunny + Normal Humidity node is mostly blue, while the Rainy + Windy node is mostly red.Â Thatâs by design. At each stage of building the decision tree, the computer will look at all of the possible options it has and choose the splitting criterion that minimizes the impurity of the subsequent nodes â that is, it tries to ensure that each of the nodes has points belonging to only one class, if possible. Of course, if we allow the computer to keep splitting the data into smaller and smaller subsets (i.e., a deep tree), we might eventually end up with a scenario where each leaf node only contains one (or very few) data points. This might lead to overfitting . Therefore the maximum allowable depth is one of the most important hyperparameters when using tree-based methods. Deep Learning Deep learning is another excellent example of a classification method. In fact, deep learning models are great at solving problems with multiple classes. Theyâre also particularly effective at dealing with nonlinear relationships and unstructured problems as theyâre able to tease out the more abstract interactions between different terms. In the What is Machine Learning section of the guide, we considered the example of a bank trying to determine whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not. This is an example of a problem where we have relatively structured data. We know, for each applicant, specific values of different metrics that we think are important and relevant to solving their problem (e.g., their income, credit score, etc.). These metrics are often referred to as features or predictors. But what about a facial recognition problem? Say we have two pictures of the same person looking in different directions. If we simply fed these two images as a string of pixels to a classical ML algorithm, it might not recognize that they are the same person because the string of pixels that it received might be quite different based on lightning conditions, the direction in which the person is looking and so on. Instead, it would make far more sense for us to try and extract useful features from the image first and then feed these as the inputs to the algorithm.Â For example, we might want to determine what the colour of their skin is, the shape of their face, the length of their nose, the colour of their eyes and so on. Since these will remain the same regardless of lighting conditions or the orientation of their face, this might be a far more robust solution. This, however, raises another problem as we might need another machine learning algorithm to, for example, distinguish between the person's face and hair. Once we've identified the hair, we may then need a second machine learning algorithm to distinguish between the different types of hairÂ  colours (since hair colours aren't discrete and 'red' hair can be many different colours in reality). As such, we may need to break down the problem into 'layers' of smaller sub-problems (also solved using machine learning) to first extract the relevant, structured features before we can feed them to the final algorithm which actually classifies faces. Deep learning, on the other hand, tries to circumvent this problem as it doesn't require us to determine these intermediate features. Instead, we can simply feed it the raw, unstructured image and it can figure out, on its own, what these relevant features might be. In doing so, it presents two significant benefits compared to classical machine learning algorithms: we may not always know which features are relevant; for example, is the length of the eyelashes relevant? Instead of having to figure out which features are relevant ourselves, a deep learning model can do the job for us and potentially also identify features we might have never thought of; and even if we know what the relevant features are, we no longer need to spend time working on actually extracting these features ourselves as the neural network does this work for us. This is also why deep learning algorithms are often considered black boxes. The complexity of their structure and the large number of layers in them means we can't precisely extract information about specific features as we might do with a linear regression model, where the coefficient for each feature imparts direct and easily interpretable information about the linear relationship between the features and the response. Why are neural networks deep? As we've discussed before, a neural network is 'deep' when it contains multiple layers. While different practitioners might differ on exactly what the threshold for a 'deep' neural network is, a neural network with more than three layers is often considered as being 'deep'. This begs the question, however, why do neural networks need to be deep? To answer this question, recall how, in the previous section, we discussed that solving a facial recognition problem may require the creation of a pipeline with multiple layers of sub-problems in order to use classical ML algorithms. Well, it turns out that that's more or less also how deep learning algorithms work. For example, in an image classification problem, research has shown that each of the layers (or a group of them) will tend to specialize toward extracting specific pieces of information about the image. For example, some layers might focus on the shapes in the image, while others might focus on colors. Adding more layers can, therefore, allow neural networks to more granularly extract information â that is, identify more types of features.Â Deeper layers also allow the neural network to learn about theÂ  more abstract interactions between different features. For example, the impact credit score has on a person's ability to repay a loan may be very different based on whether they're a student or a business owner. In a regression setting, the data scientist would need to manually specify any such interaction terms. But as we discussed before, we may not always know which interaction terms are relevant, while a deep neural network would be able to do the job for us. Its prowess with unstructured data has allowed deep learning to produce massive advances in the fields of computer vision, object detection, and natural language processing, all of which involve unstructured data and classification (for example, classifying the different objects in an image as a car or a pedestrian). Machine Learning Training Data SourcesÂ Machine Learning works by recognizing the patterns in past data, and then using them to predict future outcomes. To build a successful predictive model, you need data that is relevant to the outcome of interest. This data can take many forms - from number values (temperature, cost of a commodity, etc) to time values (dates, elapsed times) to text, images, video and audio. Fortunately the explosion in computing and sensor technology combined with the internet has enabled us to capture and store data at exponentially increasing rates. The trick is getting the right data for any particular problem - most businesses capture this in their existing technology stacks, and a lot of this data is available for free online. Structured vs Unstructured Data Structured versus unstructured data is a common topic in the field of data science, where a structured dataset typically has a well-defined schema and is organized in a table with rows and columns. Unstructured data, on the other hand, is often messy and difficult to process.Â Structured and unstructured data can both be the fuel for successful machine learning models.Â Letâs dive into the details of structured versus unstructured data, including data formats, data storage, data sources, analysis, and more. Structured vs Unstructured Data Formats Structured data is quantifiable and easy to search and analyze, and comes in predefined formats such as CSV, Excel, XML, or JSON, while unstructured data can be in a variety of less well-defined formats including PDFs, images, audio, or video.Â Structured data is typically a result of a well-defined schema, which is often created by human experts. It's easy for people to add or change the schema of structured data, but it can be very difficult to do so with unstructured data. In short, structured data is searchable and organized in a table, making it easy to find patterns and relationships. Itâs also possible to analyze and gain value from unstructured data, such as by using text extraction on PDFs, followed by text classification, but itâs a much more difficult task. Structured Data Sources Many popular business tools, like Hubspot, Salesforce, or Snowflake, are sources of structured data. Akkioâs sample datasets, which are in CSV format, are also examples of structured data. More broadly speaking, any well-defined CSV or Excel file is an example of structured data, millions of examples of which are available on sites like Kaggle or Data.gov. Unstructured Data Sources For the purpose of predictive modeling, the most common type of unstructured data is text. This includes text forms, like customer feedback forms, as well as emails, comments on social media sites, product reviews, or even notes taken during sales calls or business meetings. As weâve highlighted, unstructured data goes beyond text, and includes audio and video. For example, YouTube reviews are another source of unstructured data. YouTube videos also include AI-generated transcriptions or speech-to-text. Given that text data, text classification could be used to mine those reviews for insights. Structured vs Unstructured Data Storage Structured data is often stored in data warehouses while unstructured data is stored in data lakes. A warehouse stores structured datasets and typically relies on more traditional databases like SQL Server and Oracle for storage, while a data lake stores less well-defined datasets. Structured Data in Real-World AI Some of the most well-known machine learning models in use today are fueled by structured data.Â For example, Amazon uses its database of customer purchasing patterns and preferences to recommend items that are likely to be of interest to a particular customer. Unstructured Data in Real-World AI Other machine learning models are fueled by unstructured data.Â Tesla uses its fleet of self-driving cars to collect data about driving patterns and conditions. The data is used for teaching self-driving cars how to avoid collisions and navigate through varying driving conditions. Another example is seen in Google Photos. When you take a photo, Googleâs machine learning models scan the image, an unstructured data type, to find what category it falls into. Then, users can search their own, previously unlabeled photos by categories like âNatureâ or âPeople.â Structured Data Analysis Most analytics tools are designed for structured data, making it easier than ever to analyze and gain value from structured data. With Akkio , for instance, you can upload structured data to build and deploy AI models in minutes. In the background, machine learning algorithms scan and digest the tabular data to find patterns, creating a model that can be deployed to find those patterns in new data. Unstructured Data Analysis Unstructured data analysis is a less-common task, but itâs still highly important for businesses looking to gain value from their PDFs, image and audio data, and so on.Â Analyzing unstructured data is a complicated task, which is why itâs ignored by many businesses.Â Unstructured data can be difficult to process and understand because it's messy and in a variety of formats. Unstructured data may also be qualitative instead of quantitative, making it even harder to analyze. One use-case for unstructured data is to analyze reviews and comments on social media, both from your own company and from competitors, to inform competitive strategy. Another use-case is market analysis to find new opportunities. By analyzing unstructured market data, such as social media posts that mention customer needs, businesses can uncover opportunities for new products and features that may meet the needs of these potential customers. Quantitative vs Qualitative/Categorical Data Quantitative data is a numerical set of information, such as the height and weight of each person in a group, alongside the size of the group. Quantitative data can be further divided into two sub-categories: Discrete and continuous data.Â Discrete data does not include measurements, which are along a spectrum, but instead refers to counting numbers, like the number of products in a customerâs shopping cart, or a count of financial transactions. Continuous data, on the other hand, refers to data that can meaningfully be broken down into smaller units, or placed on a scale, like a customerâs income, an employeeâs salary, or the dollar size of a financial transaction. Qualitative data is non-numeric, such as whether or not a transaction is fraudulent, whether a review has positive or negative sentiment, or whether a sales deal has a high or low likelihood of being closed. Qualitative data is largely categorical, but it also includes things like text, whether itâs a tweet, a customer support ticket, or documentation. By the very meaning of the word, categorical data is simply data relating to categories, while quantitative data relates to quantities. Letâs dive more deeply into the differences between quantitative and qualitative data, with the latter focusing on categorical data. How to know whether your data is quantitative or categorical It can be difficult to determine if your data is categorical or quantitative, but there are a few steps you can take to find out. If your data has a numerical range of values, like income, age, transaction size, or similar, itâs quantitative. If, on the other hand, there are categories, like âYes,â âMaybe,â and âNo,â itâs categorical. You should also consider the type of answers you're expecting from your data. Are you expecting an answer that has a range of values, or just one set of values? If you're expecting one set of values, like âFraudâ or âNot Fraud,â then itâs categorical. If youâre expecting a range of values, like a certain dollar amount, then itâs quantitative. Examples of AI models you can make with quantitative data Quantitative data can be used to fuel a wide range of AI models. Letâs explore a few examples. Forecasting site traffic, given historical traffic data (e.g. if youâre going to run Google Ads on a Saturday night, what are your expected traffic numbers?)Â Determining the number of customers that will buy something, given historical transaction frequencies (e.g. if you are running a promotion, how many people will purchase an item?) Predicting how much money you will make, given historical revenue (e.g. how many people will click on an ad, and then make a purchase?)Â Determining what your inventory levels should be, given historical sales figures (e.g. what should your inventory levels look like given your sales figures?) Quantitative machine learning algorithms can use various forms of regression analysis, for instance, to find the relationship between variables.Â To give a simple example, if one variable is the weight of a patient and the other variable is the height of a patient, then the relationship between these variables can be found by running regression analysis on a set of patients. Examples of AI models you can make with categorical data Categorical data can also fuel a wide range of AI use-cases. Here are just a couple of examples. Classifying customers into different categories based on the groups of behavior they fall into (e.g. what type of device do they use to browse your website? Do they buy clothes or shoes?)Â Classifying your ads into different categories based on their effectiveness (e.g. does this ad attract more clicks than another ad?) Categorical machine learning algorithms including clustering algorithms are used to identify groups within a dataset, where the groups are based on similarity. The technical algorithm names include NaÃ¯ve Bayes and K-nearest neighbors. Understanding the intricacies of these complex algorithms used to be a prerequisite to AI modeling, but you can now build and deploy these models in minutes, with no technical expertise needed. Whatâs better: Quantitative or categorical data? There are pros and cons to each type of data, and which data type to use depends on the situation. Quantitative data is inherently more precise than categorical data, as thereâs greater granularity in quantitative data. For example, a height of â72.5 inchesâ is a lot more precise than the category âtall.â An income of â$12,000â is a lot more precise than the category âpoor.âÂ By using categories, some information can be lost.Â For instance, one American with an annual income of $0 and another with an annual income of $12,000 are both classified in the same legal categoryâpovertyâeven with significant differences in living situations. Similarly, someone with a net worth of $30 million and someone with a net worth of $100 billion are both classified as Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individuals, even while there are tens of thousands of individuals in the former category and just a few in the latter category. One disadvantage of quantitative data is that itâs harder to make sense of and model than categorical data. Categorical data inherently simplifies data by reducing the number of data points. Whatâs more common: Quantitative or categorical data? Thereâs no simple answer as to whatâs the more common data type. Categorical data is often easier to collect. For example, given someoneâs Facebook profile, you can likely get data on their race, gender, their favorite food, their interests, their education, their political party, and more, which are all examples of categorical data.Â On the other hand, you probably wouldnât be able to find out their exact income, their weight, their spending habits, or other exact quantitative metrics (with some exceptions like age). Under the hood, however, the situation is quite different, as Facebook collects vast amounts of data on each of its users, much of which is quantitative, such as the amount of time spent viewing a post, the number of posts viewed, the number of profile views, the number of link clicks, the number of application opens, and so on.Â Ultimately, we create large amounts of both data types every day, with virtually every action we take. When you pick up a new smartphone, sensors recognize that it was picked up, by tracking the exact spatial location of your phone at any point in time, which is an example of quantitative data. Then, as it recognizes that your phone was picked up, it may change a variable like âStatusâ to be âActiveâ instead of âInactive,â causing your phoneâs lock screen to light up. Time Series Time series data is a type of data that records events happening over time, which is especially useful in predicting future events. To give a very simple example, hereâs a time series dataset with three data points: In 1975, Earthâs global surface temperature was anomalous by 0.0 degrees Celsius, in 1995 it was +0.5 degrees Celsius higher than normal, and in 2015 it was +0.9 degrees Celsius higher than normal. One of the key tenets of time series data is that when something happens is as important as what happens. In marketing, for example, the time it takes a customer to go through the steps of the marketing funnel is an important predictor of revenue. Common Applications One of the most important uses of time series data is forecasting. This is because the past is the best predictor of the future. Letâs explore some common applications of time-series data, including forecasting and more. Marketing Journey Marketing is a journey, and the customer's journey through the marketing funnel can seem unpredictable.Â However, there are many ways to predict the customer's journey and reach them at the appropriate time to increase customer engagement and conversion rates. By understanding customer journeys, marketers can also create a more relevant and compelling content experience for each stage of the journey. For example, if you are running a marketing campaign on Instagram and want to know how many clicks your advertisements will receive, you could forecast clicks based on historical data. To give another example, time series forecasting can be used to predict when customers will make their next purchase. This allows companies to make decisions about when to launch new products and when to send emails or other consumer messaging. Revenue Run-Rate Revenue run-rate is predicting revenue based on what has happened in the past.Â This is an important metric for companies because it helps them plan for future revenue needs. Revenue run-rate is an annual metric, which is traditionally calculated by multiplying the average revenue per month by 12, or the average revenue per quarter by 4. This will give a rough estimate of how much revenue the company will have per year. That said, this is a very rough method of estimating revenue, which can be highly inaccurate. For example, businesses like fitness centers typically out-perform in January, due to New Yearâs resolutioners, so they wouldnât be able to accurately forecast revenue with traditional means. The opposite situation holds true for a landscaping company, which likely wonât see much business in January. A number of other variables impact revenue as well, from dynamic budgets to new competitors or new product innovation. Traditional calculations, which are based purely on multiplying historical revenue, are ignoring all these other factors. Using Akkioâs forecasting, you can accurately predict revenue run-rate based on any number of complex variables in your data. Stock or Crypto Values Predicting stock and crypto prices is notoriously difficult, especially considering the technical difficulties of manually building and deploying forecasting models. That said, for investors who are interested in forecasting assets, time series data and machine learning are must-haves. With Akkio, you can connect time series data of stock and crypto assets to forecast prices. It's important to remember that stocks and crypto are different types of investments, as crypto markets are much smaller and more volatile. Investors should be wary of their own emotions when investing in stocks and crypto. Device Health Manufacturers are using time series AI for predictive maintenance and monitoring equipment health. The AI systems are able to identify when changes need to be made to improve efficiency. They are also able to predict when equipment will break down and send alerts before it happens. These technologies are saving manufacturers money by not having to spend on unexpected repairs or urgently replace machinery when it is no longer working. Time Series Datasets For non-experts, finding high-quality time series datasets is a challenge. Fortunately, there are a huge amount of free, high-quality time series dataset sources available online. Letâs explore a couple of time series dataset sources. UCI Time-Series Repository The UCI repository features 48 time-series datasets, ranging from air quality to sales forecasting data. Most of the data is offered in CSV format, so itâs easy to read with tools like Akkio, with no manual pre-processing needed. Just connect a dataset, and youâre good to go! World Bankâs World Development Indicators The World Bank provides a wildly extensive databank featuring 79 databases for 264 countries with data as far back as 1960.Â The World Development Indicators database, for example, includes over 1,440 data columns to pick from, ranging from high-level indicators like âpercent access to electricityâ to very niche indicators like ârural population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters.â The Education Statistics database includes almost 4,000 data columns. Thereâs no easy answer to how many time-series datasets are offered, but if you treat each potential time-series dataset as a univariate problem, then there are millions of datasets from this source alone (79 databases across 264 countries with an average of 2,000 data columns). Special considerations for time series data Time series data can be a particularly tricky data type to work with, for a number of reasons. Weâve highlighted some special considerations to keep in mind when working with time-series data. Time series data is sequential, but many algorithms for predicting the future are not. In a time-series dataset, the temporal aspect is crucial, but many machine learning algorithms donât use this temporal aspect, which creates misleading models that arenât actually predictive of the future. For example, a ârandom walkâ model is a stochastic process, which means that itâs simply not possible for it to accurately predict future outcomes from historical data. To give another example, basic regression models ignore temporal correlation in the observed data and predict the next value of the time series based merely on linear regression methods. Moreover, many time series models can easily âoverfitâ to the data, by finding spurious correlations, instead of causal variables. For example, thereâs a positive correlation between ice cream sales and murder, but obviously not because eating ice cream makes you want to murder people. This is whatâs known as a âspurious correlation.âÂ In the case of ice cream sales and murder, whatâs happening is that ice cream sales increase in the summer, which is when more people go outside, causing a natural increase in crime (fewer crimes are committed when everyoneâs bundled up inside during the winter, versus, say, when thereâs a sports events in the summer with 50,000 attendees packed in a stadium). It is a lot of work to produce a model that predicts the future from time-series data. Modeling time series data is an intensive effort, requiring pre-processing, data cleaning, stationarity tests, stationarization methods like detrending or differencing, finding optimal parameters, and more. Doing this manually requires a high degree of technical expertise, not to mention a large time commitment. With Akkio, these complex processes are automated in the back-end, so you can forecast data effortlessly. Time series data is often not as accurate when it comes to predicting the future, because many things that have happened in the past are simply no longer relevant to the future. If youâve ever considered investing, youâve likely read a financial disclaimer along the lines of: âPast performance is no guarantee of future results.â Itâs actually a legal requirement for asset management firms to give such a disclaimer, because, well, thereâs really no way to know what the future holds. The best we can do is assign probabilities to certain values. Indeed, even generating accurate probabilities is immensely challenging, as the world is constantly changing. Predicting COVID-19 cases is a great example of the challenges of time series forecasting, as virtually all forecasts failed . Even now, accurate forecasts are extremely difficult, considering that much past data is no longer relevant for the future, given new vaccines, new strains, and ever-changing regulations around travel, social distancing, quarantines, and so on. Feature engineering for time series data Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing data. One challenge with time series data is that itâs often not stationary. Stationarity means that a time series is a sequence of observations of the same variable, taken at equally spaced times. If the observations are equally spaced in time and do not contain any trends or seasonality, then itâs stationary.Â Creating stationary data is a form of feature engineering, and the two most common techniques for transforming time series into stationary data are differencing and transforming. That said, with no-code AI tools like Akkio, you can build and deploy time series models without any manual feature engineering needed, as this is all done automatically after a dataset is connected. How much data do I need to train an ML model? Data is the fuel that makes machine learning tick. For the most part, the more data you have, the more accurate your model will be, but there are many cases where you can get by with less. Machine learning models are pattern matching machines. They can only capture and predict patterns that have been seen before. This is the one big catch with machine learning. If you want to predict what happens with new data, the model has to have seen similar data before. It's also important to note that there's no golden rule for how much data you need. For example, while Akkioâs lead scoring demo dataset has over 40,000 rows of data, the text classification demo dataset has just 1,000 rows of data, and both achieve roughly 90% accuracy. Meanwhile, the credit card fraud demo dataset has nearly 300,000 rows of data! It's best to explore the modeling process for your dataset and see what it takes to get high accuracy. Do you have too little data? Accurate machine learning models can be made with as little as a few hundred rows of data. If you truly have extremely little data, say less than a few hundred rows, you can try a few things. One is data augmentation: A process where data is generated by adding in fake data examples. You can also merge in other datasets, whether internal or external, on shared columns to increase the overall dataset size.Â For example, suppose youâre building a model to classify customer support tickets based on urgency. If you need more data, youâll want to ensure that you have a pipeline in place thatâs generating this data for you. In such a case, your support teams should be tagging the urgency of incoming tickets, so you can later export this data to fuel your machine learning model. Depending on the use-case, you can even turn to crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk. These platforms allow you to hire people from all over the world to do small tasks for you at low prices, like collecting and labelling data. You may not want to do this if you're a small company with limited resources, but if you're a large company and want more data quickly, this may be a good option for you. Yet another method is to scrape data from the Internet, which is again use-case dependent, but potentially an easy way to boost your dataset size, given the open nature of a lot of Internet data, such as social media posts. Do you have too much data? There are instances when it feels like you could have too much data. If your dataset is too large, it becomes difficult to explore and understand what the data is telling you. This is particularly the case with big data in the order of many gigabytes, or even terabytes, which cannot be analyzed with regular tools like Excel or even typical Python Pandas code. Given that itâs possible to make high-quality machine learning models with much smaller datasets, this problem can be solved by sampling from the larger dataset, and using the derived, smaller sample to build and deploy models. ML models at any size A good example of a massive AI model is Googleâs latest language model , which is an incredible 1.6 trillion parameters in sizeâtoo large for us to practically comprehend, though for comparison, there are just 86 billion neurons in the human brain. At the same time, itâs possible to build machine learning models that are around 10 orders of magnitude smaller than Googleâs language model.Â For example, the perceptron is a classifier that was developed in the 1950s. These single-layer neural networks are trained by assigning inputs to different outputs, with the network adjusting its weights until it can correctly predict the output for new inputs. The perceptron is limited by its lack of memory and by not being able to extrapolate relationships between data points that it might not have seen, but at its core, it can be the basis of a functioning model with just a few parameters. Quantity isn't everything It's important to remember that quantity isn't everything when it comes to data. Even if you have a lot of data, your model may not work well. In order to have high quality models, you need high quality data. This means that your data needs to be clean and easy to work with so that it can be used effectively. In other words, itâs better to have a small, high-quality dataset thatâs indicative of the problem that youâre trying to solve, than a large, generic dataset riddled with quality issues. After all, not all data is valuable. As Nate Silver, Founder of FiveThirtyEight, says : âEvery day, three times per second, we produce the equivalent of the amount of data that the Library of Congress has in its entire print collection, right? But most of it is like cat videos on YouTube or 13-year-olds exchanging text messages about the next Twilight movie.â Experiment to find out how much data you need Machine learning is getting easier and faster. There's no need to waste a lot of time on preparation, as a huge dataset isnât a prerequisite. As Adam Savage puts it: âIn the spirit of science, there really is no such thing as a âfailed experiment.ââ Simply experiment and see how much data you need.Â In the last few years, machine learning and AI tools have been getting simpler and faster. The days of waiting weeks or months for building and deploying models are over. With Akkio, you can build a model in as little as 10 seconds, which means that the process of figuring out how much data you really need for an effective model is quick and effortless. With traditional machine learning, you typically need a large dataset in order to get sufficient training data. But with Akkio, it's possible to create compelling models with as little as 100 or 1000 examples. As weâve explored, if you find that youâre not getting great results with a small dataset, you can always try merging on new data, data augmentation, crowdsourcing platforms, or simply turning to online dataset sources. Data preparation for machine learningÂ Preparing your data for the training of a machine learning model can range from simply connecting your existing business operations technology platforms (Salesforce, Marketo, and Hubspot, etc) and data-stores (Snowflake, Google Big Query, etc) to business wide data hygiene programs that take months but yield clean data for optimum performance. You also need to narrow down the dataset used for training so it only has the information available to you when you want to predict a key outcome. We have designed Akkio to work with messy data as well as clean - and are firm believers in capturing 90% of the value of machine learning at a fraction of the cost of a data hygiene initiative. To learn more about preparing your data for machine learning click here . Data augmentation for machine learning The performance of a machine learning model is primarily dependent on the predictive accuracy of its training dataset with respect to the outcome of interest. If you were able to know everything about a system (quantum physics aside) you would be able to perfectly predict its future state. In reality most datasets contain a small subset of information about a system - but that is often more than enough to build a valuable ML model. That said, adding in additional data can often help improve predictive performance. This is called data augmentation. To learn more about data augmentation for machine learning click here . Bias in Machine Learning: What is it and how can it be avoided? One very important thing to be aware of when using machine learning is that biases in the dataset used to train the model will be reflected in the decision making of the model itself. Sometimes these biases are not obvious in your data - take for example zip or postal codes. Location information encodes a lot of information that might not be obvious at first glance - everything from weather to population density to income, housing, to demographics information like age and ethnicity. These patterns can be helpful, but also have the potential to be harmful when the models are used in ways that reinforce unwanted discriminatory outcomes (both ethically and legally). Click here to learn more about bias in machine learning and how to minimize it. Use Cases of Machine Learning Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that is focused on systems that can learn from data.Â While weâll explore some of the top applications of machine learning across a number of industries, the academic world is also using AI, largely for research in areas such as biology, chemistry, and materials science. Energy Renewable Energy Renewable energy is one of the fastest-growing sources of power generation worldwide. In 2020, it accounted for 80 percent of new power capacity globally. AI is critical for successful adoption. AI can balance electricity supply and demand needs in real-time, optimize energy use and storage to reduce rates, and help integrate new, clean sources into existing infrastructures. AI can also predict and prevent power outages in the future by learning from past events. For example, when a grid is overwhelmed by demand, AI can forecast the trajectory for that gridâs flow of energy and power usage, then act to prevent a power outage. AI can also predict when a power outage will occur in the future, so utilities can take proactive measures to minimize the outageâs effects. Additionally, AI can even help with wind energy. The power of the wind is ever-present, but harnessing it is not easy. Windmills have been used for centuries to capture wind power, but this process is difficult and costly. But now AI can change the game. AI can calculate how wind turbines should be rotated so that as few turbines as possible are in the wind shadow of the other. Using data collected from the terrain, the height and size of the turbines, and meteorological data, AI can work out how wind turbines should be rotated to harness the wind. Insurance Insurance Pricing The insurance industry is highly competitive. The simple fact is that if you are not consistently profitable, you will be driven out of the market. To maintain profitability, insurance firms must be able to accurately predict high-risk, high-cost individuals. Indeed, data shows that 70 percent of new North American insurance companies fail within 10 years. This is the status quo, as insurance firms often cannot accurately price their plans, leading to tremendous losses. AI has been shown to be highly accurate when it comes to predicting future claims costs. This accuracy allows you to assess the risk of insuring an individual based on their past claims history and use this information to correctly price your premiums. This is crucial because it will allow you to stay profitable in a high-risk industry where you are always at risk of being driven out of business by adverse selection. With Akkio, AI-powered cost modeling can be done in clicks, enabling insurers to leapfrog competitors that are stuck using traditional, laborious, and inaccurate cost models. This cost modeling solves one of the biggest problems insurers face today: Choosing who to insure, and at what rates. Claim Development Modeling In the insurance industry, it's all about risk management. And when you're making predictions about risk, you want to do it right. In the past, the industry relied on outdated modeling techniques that often led to under- or over-pricing claims. That led to higher premiums for consumers and a host of other problems. But AI is solving this problem. With these new machine learning techniques, it's possible to accurately predict a claim cost and build accurate prediction models within minutes. Not only that, but insurers can even build models to predict how claims costs will change, and account for case estimation changes. That means insurance companies can price their policies more accurately and offer lower premiums for consumers, leading to lower costs of coverage for everyone. It also helps insurers be more competitive and attract more customers, which is especially important as the industry faces stiff competition. Akkioâs platform makes this possible by enabling users to create models based on their own data, and then deploy them across any number of environments with just a few clicks. This reduces the need for costly and time-consuming custom development work, and translates into lower costs for the company overall. It also enables insurers to respond faster to a changing insurance market, which provides a critical edge against competitors that are still relying on outdated techniques like regression modeling in Excel. The result is an improved customer experience that translates into higher sales volume and happier shareholders. Claim Payment Automation Modeling Claims are a major expense for insurance companies and a frustrating process for policyholders. At the same time, insurance claims are extremely common , as by the age of 34, every person driving since they were 16 are likely to have filed at least one car insurance claim. The inefficiencies in processing claims is bad for both parties: the customer wastes time and the insurance company spends more on processing than they could have spent on settling the claim. Akkio's no-code machine learning can model when it's best to pay off claims automatically, so that you can minimize wait times for customers and maximize ROI for your business. Predicting when a customer will make a claim is not simple. Your risk profile changes over time, and so does the competitiveness of your market. Given the right historical data, Akkio's machine learning models take all of this into account, making it easy to find the optimal solution for your specific needs.Â Simply upload your data, and let Akkio do the heavy lifting, giving you more time to focus on what really matters: running your business. Insurance Conversion Modeling Insurance companies are always searching for new ways to attract new customers, and they need to optimize their marketing efforts to help them grow. A key problem that many insurance companies are struggling with is how to make accurate pricing decisions. Given that insurance is sold by quoting a policy, accurately estimating the conversion rate from quote to policy is essential. Akkio allows you to gather historical data, make estimates about the probability of conversion, and then use those predictions to drive your pricing decisions. Accurately modeling insurance conversion is key because it is an important determinant of insurance company profitability. A key benefit of an AI-based approach is that it allows insurance companies to adjust prices for customer segments without manually creating and testing a wide range of pricing variants. This ensures that marketing dollars are spent effectively and efficiently on segments where there is the greatest chance of conversion.Â Fraudulent Claim Modeling With over $40 billion in insurance fraud in the US alone, according to FBI statistics, it's no wonder that insurers are looking for ways to reduce fraudulent payouts. One solution is to use machine learning to create models that can predict the probability of a claim being legitimate or not. Fraudulent claim modeling is an excellent example of how predictive modeling can be used to analyze fraud in the insurance industry. Using a model built on past payouts, an insurer could, for instance, apply a scoring system to claims and automatically reject or flag those with high probability of being fraudulent. Fraudulent claims donât just reduce the bottom-line for insurers, they can even lead directly to corporate bankruptcy, as research indicates . Moreover, fraud hurts consumers, who pay up to $700 a year in the form of increased premiums, in the US. The traditional means of detecting fraud are inefficient and ineffective, as itâs impossible for humans to manually analyze vast amounts of data at scale, which lets fraud slip through the cracks. Akkio's potential in this area goes beyond the insurance industry. Modeling fraud is a popular use-case in the financial sector as well, for example to help eliminate fraudulent credit card applications and transactions. Life Insurance Underwriting for Impaired Customers Many life insurance companies do not underwrite customers who suffered from some serious diseases such as cancer. This is because it requires them to spend a long and expensive medical assessment process on the customer. In insurance, the term âimpairedâ refers to applicants who donât meet the standard criteria to obtain a very affordable rate. As a result, impaired applicants are often un- or under-insured. It's a wise business decision to increase the coverage for impaired customers and Akkioâs AI is able to provide that capability. While many who suffer from a serious disease can be accurately identified through a questionnaire, Akkio can achieve an even higher degree of accuracy by integrating the applicant's medical history and conditions. AI-driven predictive models use these factors to predict the risk of underwriting a serious disease survivor. The model predicts the risk of death, which is the ultimate impairment in insurance. For insurers, itâs possible to build the model in just minutes, opening up a new line of business and boosting the bottom line. FinTech and Banking Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions Credit card fraud is a huge problem costing billions of dollars per year. Fraudulent transactions cost $28 billion in 2018, and they continue to grow rapidly. In fact, annual losses are expected to exceed $40 billion by the end of the decade. With Akkio's no-code machine learning, the likelihood of fraudulent transactions can be predicted effortlessly. This reduces the number of fraudulent transactions, while at the same time increases customer satisfaction. For banks, this means less cost per transaction and more revenue and profit. Akkio's fraud detection for credit card transactions is one example of how Akkio can help banks. By using a historical transaction dataset, machine learning models identify suspicious patterns and account for factors that are often overlooked in credit card transactions, like IP address changes, high-risk browsing behavior, or a low level of engagement with the transaction.Â By using proprietary AI training methods, Akkio can be used to build fraudulent transaction models in minutes, which can be deployed in any setting via API. Credit Default Rates Credit default rate is the percentage of loans that default. The credit default rate problem is difficult to model due to its complexity, with many factors influencing an individual's or company's likelihood of default, such as industry, credit score, income, and time. Understanding the factors that lead to credit card defaults can help lenders better assess the risk of lending to borrowers, and ultimately boost the bottom-line. Credit risk is a measure of the likelihood that a person will be unable to repay a debt, and this is what lenders use to determine whether or not to offer credit. In finance, credit risk is the risk of default on an obligation that arises due to the uncertainty of future cash flow. Akkio's API can help any organization that needs accurate credit risk models in a fraction of the time it would take to build them on their own. Akkio makes it easy to build a model that predicts the likelihood of default based on data from the past.Â In addition, Akkio can be used for automatic model retraining, so that once a model is built, it's easy to maintain and update as needed. This makes it possible for organizations not just to save time on predictive modeling tasks but also to be confident in their models at all times. Digital Wealth Management Digital Wealth Management is a competitive field. In this market, it's not just about having the best investment products, but also about how to distribute them effectively while managing client assets. Akkio's machine learning algorithms can be deployed to constantly analyze data from your existing clients' portfolios to find new opportunities and assign values for each of your prospects. It's important to diversify your portfolio to make sure you are investing in the right technologies and companies. AI can help diversity portfolios by finding new investment opportunities Akkio helps asset managers learn which customers are more likely to invest in particular categories based on their previous investments and demographic information, as well as information like their risk appetite. AI can even be used to automate investment analysis, by ingesting financial data from sources like a securities market to predict the probability of stock prices rising or falling. These predictions can then provide real-time strategy recommendations for individuals or institutional investors. The result? A successful asset management strategy that attracts new clients and captures a greater share of existing client assets at the same time. Further, algorithms have been used in stock trading for decades. For example, a 1986 New York Times article titled âWall Streetâs Tomorrow Machineâ discussed the use of computers for evaluating new trading opportunities. Todayâs AI trading is a form of automated trading that uses algorithms to find patterns in the market and make trades. AI traders can also be used to optimize portfolios with respect to risk and return objectives and are often used in trading organizations. AI-powered trading systems can also use sentiment analysis to identify trading opportunities in the securities market. Sophisticated AI algorithms can find buy and sell signals based on the tone of social media posts. Blockchain A blockchain is a decentralized database that stores information in blocks of data. The blocks are linked together through cryptography to create a history of all transactions. The system relies on consensus among the users of the network about the validity of information and data, making blockchains more secure than other types of databases. However, as blockchain technology becomes more popular, security threats are also increasing. Larger blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are practically impossible to attack due to the sheer amount of resources required. That said there are hundreds of smaller blockchains at risk. MIT Technology Review reports , âmarketing slogans and headlines that called the technology âunhackableâ were dead wrong,â as blockchains can be rewritten if an attacker is able to muster over 51% of the computational power defending a network allowing the attacker to reallocate ownership of funds. One such example is when Ethereum Classic (a fork off of Ethereum) suffered a 51% attack 3 times in a single month . In 2020, there were over 120 blockchain attacks, leading to losses to the tune of nearly $4 billion. While preventing 51% attacks depends on distributed participants allocating compute resources to chain defense, users and exchanges need to be able to detect anomalous behavior when it happens on a chain (so they can attempt to minimize loss of funds). Akkio's machine learning algorithms can detect anomalies in real-time, alerting you and enabling you to take action quickly before additional damage is done. With Akkio's AutoML, it only takes minutes to build a fraud detection system tailored to your needs. Healthcare Drug Delivery Optimization The pharmaceutical supply chain is notoriously fragile , leading to shortages, higher costs, and safety issues. Part of these issues lie in under-optimized drug delivery systems. Pharmaceutical firms spend millions of dollars shipping drug samples to doctors and hospitals. Simple analyses uncover situations for order consolidation, such as when the same location requests two or more drug samples. However, manually looking at the data for order consolidation quickly becomes infeasible at scale. AI helps optimize supply chain delivery processes by predicting which orders can be consolidated, no matter how complex or how many orders there are to process. Thatâs the killer advantage of AI: Itâs incredibly fast and accurate compared to traditional techniques. AI can be used to find the best locations for consolidated shipping, estimate cost savings, and improve customer satisfaction. Instead of putting out fires related to unoptimized supply chains, health systems can now focus on what truly matters: Helping patients. Disease Propensity In a world of virtually unlimited data and powerful analytics, it's easy to see why health systems are looking for ways to better understand the health of their patients. With AI platforms, teams can connect to various data sources, like lab results and HIE, and use machine learning models to predict the severity of a patient's condition and what type of care they will need. Medical professionals should consider screening patients that may have a higher likelihood for a particular disease. If they see a patient that could be predisposed to developing an illness, treating them right away will lead to better health outcomes, in addition to being more fiscally responsible than not seeing them until they're carrying it. Ultimately, using AI to automate disease propensity modeling has the potential to save hospitals and other healthcare providers millions of dollars per year by reducing unnecessary emergency room visits and readmissions. Modeling ICU Occupancy Staffing and budgeting for a hospital ICU is always a difficult decision, and it's even harder when you don't know how quickly the patient load will change. With machine learning, hospitals can easily make projections about their occupancy by modeling historic data to account for trends. Exceeding capacity limits, as has happened in ICU rooms around the world as of late, often results directly in patient death. Higher occupancy rates are clearly correlated to higher death rates . With AI, hospitals can quickly create a model that forecasts occupancy rates, which consequently leads to more accurate budgeting and staffing decisions. Machine learning models help hospitals save lives, reduce staffing inefficiencies, and better prepare for incoming patients. Forecasting models also help hospitals make better decisions about what services they need to offer their patients. Healthcare has been rapidly changing over the last few years, with an increased focus on providing holistic care and individualized treatment plans. Further, forecasting can help hospitals anticipate patient needs and provide the right services to meet expectations. Ultimately, machine learning algorithms make it easy for hospitals to predict the next step in their operations and make more informed decisions about future staffing needs. The result is healthier, happier patients and a stronger bottom line for hospitals. Estimating Sepsis Risk Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that can develop suddenly and with devastating consequences. It is a leading cause of death in intensive care units and in hospital settings, and the incidence of sepsis is on the rise . Doctors and nurses are constantly challenged by the need to quickly assess patient risk for developing sepsis, which can be difficult when symptoms are non-specific. Decades ago, sepsis wasnât much of a concern. Today, sepsis accounts for almost a fifth of human deaths. AI complements medical professionals' expertise by providing data-driven insights to identify patients at high risk for developing sepsis. Medical professionals can leverage the power of machine learning to aggregate patient data and generate automated alerts tailored to each patient's unique needs. Machine learning models are designed to learn from historical data, which can include past sepsis cases, to provide accurate predictions, enabling healthcare professionals to confidently identify patients at high risk for developing sepsis. Hospital Readmission Risk The average cost of a hospital readmission ranges from $15,000 to $25,000 , which leads to wasted resources, unnecessary tests, potentially harmful treatments, delayed patient care, and other damaging consequences. Machine learning can help in reducing readmission risk via predictive analytics models that identify at-risk patients. By feeding in historical hospital discharge data, demographics, diagnosis codes, and other factors, medical professionals can calculate the probability that the patient will have a readmission. AI makes it easy for hospitals to identify which patients are most at-risk for readmissions. No-code AI tools donât require any IT work or coding, so hospitals can save money and improve the quality of care they provide. Ultimately, AI's hospital readmission risk use-case can help hospitals reduce their costs and increase the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients. Public Sector Counterterrorism Terrorism is a top concern for intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world. After 9/11, preventing terrorist attacks became a heavily-funded, prime directive for a number of government agencies. As described in a United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism report on AI , government agencies can use predictive modeling to identify red flags of radicalization, detect the spread of terrorist misinformation, and counter terrorist narratives. Machine learning isn't just for marketing; it can also be used to help prevent terror attacks by identifying patterns in past events and predicting future ones, saving lives, and making the world a safer place. Fraud detection Fraud is an issue that is costly, not only to the government and its citizens, but to companies as well. Every government agency from the IRS to the Social Security Administration suffers significant losses from fraud.Â In fact, as explored in an Association of Certified Fraud Examiners report , a study of nearly 3,000 cases of occupational fraud found that government entities ""were the most represented sectors among the fraud cases analyzed."" While much public discourse centers around governments as perpetrators of fraud, the reality is often that government employees and agencies are often the targets of a wide-range of fraudulent activities. Fraudulent activities can be difficult to detect, costing agencies valuable time and resources. Ultimately, AI makes it easy for government agencies to detect fraudulent activities as they happen, saving them time and resources while also safeguarding taxpayer dollars. Insider threat In the age of digital transformation, attack vectors are getting ever larger. As a result, even government agencies are at risk of being breached by insiders (or ex-employees) who want to use their data for malicious purposes. At the same time, there are a number of insider threats that can seem innocuous in nature, but costly nonetheless, such as sending company information over a personal account, or even accidentally misconfiguring access credentials. For example, while cybersecurity firms like to keep their exact techniques private, research shows that AI can accurately identify malicious emails, which cost governments billions of dollars if undetected. To make sure that firms donât have to pay for these kinds of internal breaches, agencies need to proactively block any potential misuse, using machine learning to identify risks.Â Cybersecurity Cyberattacks are on the rise, with real-world consequences for everyday people. Recently, for instance, hackers stopped gasoline and jet fuel pipelines and closed off beef and pork production at a leading US supplier. These are just a couple of examples of the tens of thousands of annual cybersecurity attacks. One of the main challenges in cybersecurity today is an ever-growing attack vector. As more and more of our world goes digital, thereâs more data to keep track of, and itâs easier for hackers to go unnoticed. Manually combing through this data can only get you so far, but AI can scan massive amounts of data in real-time. No-code AI enables security teams to build, deploy and refresh models to predict incoming threats in real-time, whether itâs scanning incoming emails for malicious threats or flagging concerning IP activity, so they can prevent a breach before it happens. Ultimately, this enables security teams to reduce their risk exposure and prepare for an increasingly hostile cyber landscape. Teams that fail to deploy AI for cybersecurity will be more vulnerable to attacks compared to other market players who do. Customer Support Support Ticket Topic Classification Good customer service is of universal importance, with surveys indicating that 96% of customers feel customer service is important in their choice of loyalty to a brand. Customer service is also a major factor in customer retention. In other words, people are more likely to stay with a company if they're satisfied with the service they receive. AI-based classification of customer support tickets can help companies respond to queries in an efficient manner. By combining natural language processing and machine learning, AI can be used to automatically group queries into predefined categories, making it easy for customer support teams to select the appropriate department to handle a query based on their area of expertise. Essentially, by digesting past queries to find patterns in terms of content, AI can learn how to classify new tickets more accurately and efficiently. This means that with time, AI-based ticket classification will become an integral part of any organizationâs customer service strategy. Support Ticket Prioritization Customer support teams need to handle a huge number of customer queries in a limited time, and they're often not sure which tickets need to be addressed first. Machine learning models can rank tickets according to their urgency, with the most urgent tickets addressed first. This relieves teams of the burden of deciding which tickets require the most attention, freeing up more time for actually addressing tickets and satisfying customers. Predictive analytics is also useful for identifying patterns in the data so that customer queries can be more accurately met with answers, and it allows teams to improve their customer experience by responding faster. Social Media Sentiment Analysis Social media is an invaluable tool for marketing and customer support teams, but it's a complicated and fast-moving landscape. Every day, millions of people post their thoughts, opinions, and suggestions to social media about brands they're interacting with. From a raving comment to a scathing review, social media posts can have a big impact on your company's success.Â Machine learning can help teams make sense of the vast amount of social media data, by automatically classifying the sentiment of posts in real-time thanks to models trained on historical data. This enables teams to respond faster and more effectively to customer feedback. Ultimately, this allows marketers and customer service teams to identify early warning signs of dissatisfaction before they spiral out of control and needlessly drive away customers. Sales Finding Duplicate Customer Records in Your Database In the process of data entry, we know that errors will be made. Humans are not perfect and this includes those who code the data: editing mistakes can occur such as inverting an âSâ or a âZâ in the input document. It is reasonable to assume that there may be multiple copies of your records in which different people may have typed one letter wrong or did not notice inconsistent formatting, such as âsmithâ versus âSmith,â before saving it as a new version. Additionally, data can be brought in by multiple systems, with different column values, such that duplicates wonât be found by traditional means (e.g. one system has the first and last name, while another system has their email). Detecting duplicates is notoriously difficult, requiring manual intervention to identify duplicate records. This can be time-consuming and prone to human error. AI is different: it's fully automated and can detect duplicates for all types of fields with high accuracy. AI is essential for complex deduplication tasks, because the same record could show up multiple times throughout your database. With AI, you can detect these duplicates even if they have different data fields - making it easy to clean up your database so that it adheres to best practices without any manual intervention. Lead Scoring Lead scoring is a powerful way to determine which leads are most in need of your attention. AI enables teams to automatically predict the likelihood that each lead will become a paying customer. Armed with these insights, marketing teams can decide which leads to pursue and spend time on, and which to put on the back-burner. Todayâs lead scoring is powered by machine learning that leverages any historical data, whether from Salesforce, Snowflake, Google Sheets, or any other source, to predict the likelihood a given lead will convert.Â This insight helps marketing teams to identify leads that are in need of more attention, as well as those that are likely to be a waste of time for the team. Sales Forecasting As a business, forecasting is one of your most important tasks. It's what allows you to plan ahead and make better use of your budget. Machine learning can help you do that with unparalleled accuracy, even in unpredictable economic environments. No-code AI can be used to quickly build a model from past sales data and predict the sales you're likely to receive in the future. With no-code AI, you can get accurate forecasts in a matter of seconds by uploading your product catalog and past sales data. Instead of relying on rules of thumb or gut feelings, AI offers a more scientific approach that lets you make better decisions about your budget, staff hiring, and promotional campaigns. This is essential for businesses that need to know how to budget for the future or optimize their limited resources. Forecasting models can be deployed through a web-based interface, API, Salesforce, or even through Zapier, making it easy to get started in any setting without requiring any data science know-how. Marketing Direct Marketing The way we consume goods has changed. In the past, we would go to the store, pick out what we needed, and purchase it. Nowadays, we can order what we need from the comfort of our own home and have it delivered to our door. As a result, the way we are marketed to has changed. Direct marketing is an excellent way for businesses to reach their potential customers, and itâs a largely under-utilized opportunity. That said, it's often difficult to determine which prospects are the most likely to purchase. Marketing to uninterested leads isnât just a waste of time and money - it can be a huge turn-off to those leads from ever deciding to make a purchase decision. That's where data-driven AI comes in. AI can find the best prospects among a particular group and determine the best way to reach them. This means you can quickly and easily identify the most valuable leads, and then contact them with a personalized message that speaks to their particular needs. With no-code AI, you can effortlessly prioritize and classify leads based on their likelihood of converting, all at a fraction of the time and cost that traditional methods require. Loyalty Program Usage A loyalty program is a reward program that gives points or other awards to customers who shop at a particular establishment. A typical example might be a program that provides each customer with ten points for every dollar spent at the store, and if a customer collects 1,000 points, they are given $10 off their purchase. Loyalty programs are designed to incentivize customers to shop with the company on a regular basis, and they usually consist of various tiers of rewards, depending on how much the customer spends each time. The most effective type of loyalty program is one that provides increased benefits based on the amount of money spent, as customers are more likely to be motivated by the prospect of an increased reward.Â Unfortunately, even if you have a good understanding of your customers' behaviors and preferences, it is not easy to predict which rewards will incentivize them most effectively. While your neighborhood coffee shop might offer a free coffee for every fifth visit, the scale and complexity of loyalty programs are orders of magnitude greater for large, data-driven firms. Machine learning algorithms can analyze past data and detect which customer segments are most likely to respond positively to certain rewards. This helps managers make informed decisions about which rewards to offer and when, increasing the likelihood that they will convert. Next Best Offer One of the best ways that marketers can create a personalized experience for customers is by considering the ""next best offer."" This requires marketers to take into account all of the possible actions they could take with that customer and then select the most appropriate one. As an example, suppose that a customer visits a website for information on renting. The customer can't decide between a studio or one-bedroom apartment, so she searches for more information on both and cannot find any definitive information. In this case, the ""next best offer"" could be to create a personalized email with links to articles and videos from both types of apartments, so the customer can decide which one is better for her. Doing this manually is clearly impossible at scale. Businesses can use AI to offer the right product to the right person at the right time.Â Businesses can automatically make recommendations in real-time, using predictive models that account for customer preferences, price sensitivity, and product availability, or any data provided for training. Predicting the right offer for the right person at the right time is a huge undertaking, but AI makes it easy for retailers to optimize their operations. Best of all, retailers don't need any data scientists or AI specialists to deploy predictive models - no-code AI automatically powers recommendations with no coding required. Multichannel Marketing Attribution If your marketing budget includes advertising on social media, the web, TV, and more, it can be difficult to tell which channels are most responsible for driving sales. With machine learning-driven attribution modeling, teams can quickly and easily identify which marketing activities are driving the most revenue. Marketing attribution models are traditionally built through large-scale statistical analysis, which is time-consuming and expensive. No-code AI platforms can build accurate attribution models in just seconds, and non-technical teams can deploy the models in any setting. This lets marketing teams keep costs down while still pinpointing exactly where to allocate their marketing budget to optimize for the best ROI. Ultimately, this makes it easier to ensure that every dollar spent on marketing is worth it, so you're consistently getting the most out of your marketing budget. By automating attribution, marketers can overcome the boring stuff and get more creative with what really matters. Armed with knowledge on how specific channels are performing, marketers can finally double-down on high-performing channels, eliminate the laggards, and strategize how to move forward. Product Personalization Consumers today expect personalized products and content.Â Machine learning enables businesses to finally target consumers with the right message, at the right time, and on the right channel. For example, rather than using one message to reach everyone on your website, machine learning could be used for sentiment analysis of customer reviews on your site, or your CRM or social media tools, to present different customer segments with different messages. In addition, AI platforms can be trained on historical product purchase data to build a product recommendations model. For example, if a customer has purchased a certain product in the past, an AI API can be deployed to recommend related products that the customer is likely to be interested in. This can be a powerful propellant for the bottom line, as research shows that 80% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences. Beyond personalized experiences, AI can even be used for personalizing products and services themselves. While today, many of these individualized products are created by an individual designer or a custom order, personalized AI will make this process much more efficient, tailoring the product to an individual customer's needs and delivering it in a matter of days. Customer Churn The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition, is the number of customers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. For a company to grow, it must acquire more new customers than its churn rate. It's quite a challenge to prevent customer churn, which is why it's so important for companies to be proactive. Fortunately, AI has the power to do just that. Machine learning algorithms can identify the data patterns common among customers who are likely to churn, such as those with a high cost of acquisition or those that are misaligned with your ideal customer persona.Â Armed with this knowledge, you can optimize your retention strategy by targeting high-risk customers with personalized offers or incentives before they leave. Moreover, marketing teams can tailor their strategies to avoid high-churn-profile leads. The more data you have, the better. AI platforms like Akkio allow you to work with your data sources wherever they are - your CRM system, data warehouses, and other databases - to create the best model for predicting churn for your business. Next Best Action When it comes to marketing, there are always more tactics to explore than time or resources allow. Trying to decide which channel or activity to focus on that will have the biggest impact on revenue means you're forced to make guesses. AI can put those guesses to the test. Machine learning algorithms can be fed with data from all of your marketing channels, as well as customer lifecycle information, to identify which activities are most likely to move each individual customer closer to purchase. A/B testing is a great way to figure out how best to allocate marketing resources, but only if you can measure success accurately. That's where machine learning excels: it's able not only to measure and predict sales, but also predict what might happen if you try any given marketing tactic.Â Google AdWords Bidding Google AdWords is a huge part of most advertising budgets, but it can be difficult to get bidding right. If you bid too low, you lose out on opportunities. If you bid too high, your marketing ROI will dwindle.Â However, machine learning can make this process easier by building a model off of past marketing and sales activities to predict the sales volume attributable to each AdWord, making it easy to determine the optimal price to bid to achieve your target ROI while avoiding losing the word to a competitor. It is incredibly difficult and time-consuming for teams to build auction models that can capture complex human behavior. But no-code AI can be used to build accurate models with just a few clicks. Companies can deploy these models easily with an API in any setting or even with no-code tools like Zapier.Â Ultimately, this enables marketing teams to boost the effectiveness of their ad spend, which is critical for success in an ever-more competitive landscape for consumer attention. Teams that fail to deploy AI for AdWords bidding will lose directly to their competitors that are using data-driven strategies. Lead Scoring Lead scoring is a crucial part of any marketing campaign because it helps you focus your time and resources on the potential customers that are most likely to become paying customers. In other words, an accurate lead scoring model helps you go where the money is. In fact, over two-thirds of marketers point to lead scoring as a top revenue contributor. Accurate lead scoring can be tough, though. It's not easy to measure how well a customer will interact with your product without knowing much about them, so traditional lead scoring models rely on interest from the prospect to determine the score. Traditional approaches are highly limited, since they donât necessarily indicate the prospectâs ability or true probability of making a purchase. That's where AI comes in. Machine learning models use a wide range of factors to score marketing leads. With data-driven lead scoring models, you can have more confidence in your marketing decisions because you're looking at more data points than just interest from the prospect. Employee Retention Studies have shown that attracting and retaining top talent is one of the most important factors in a company's success. After all, the average employee exit costs an entire third of their annual salary. However, as employee-employer relationships are shifting, the challenge of getting and keeping top talent is getting tougher. Year after year, employee attrition is increasing, and some are calling this crisis â The Great Resignation .â But there's hope: data. No-code AI platforms let HR professionals scan massive amounts of data - from hiring pipelines to employee history or performance reviews - to uncover insights to keep your best people working for your team.Â With no-code AI, you can use machine learning algorithms to create predictive models that let you predict when an employee might be considering a job change, when they might be considering leaving their current position, or if they're simply unsatisfied. This data-driven approach illuminates potential issues before they become major problems, giving HR teams the high-quality insights they need for more informed decision-making. With tools like Zapier, HR teams can even deploy predictive models in any setting without writing code. How can I create and deploy a machine learning model? For many, machine learning might as well be magic. But the truth is, as weâve seen, that itâs really just advanced statistics, empowered by the growth of data and more powerful computers. Having said that, machine learning models are incredibly versatile tools that can add tremendous value across business units. We saw earlier, for example, how finance teams can use machine learning to predict fraud , marketing teams can score leads or predict churn , HR teams can predict attrition , and more. Building the machine learning models to make these use-cases possible was once an arduous, resource-intensive task, requiring technical experts for data engineering, building pipelines, coding, maintaining infrastructure, and more. As weâve explored, no-code AI allows anyone to create and deploy machine learning models on their own, without needing programming skills. However, to become truly AI-driven, getting AI to work for you is not a one-time upgrade. It is a journey that will require an understanding of data management and the use of machine learning. Another reason that code-based AI is problematic is that there is a shortage of programmers, and the shortfall is expected to grow as the AI industry grows. As ACM reports , thereâs actually a recent decrease in computer science graduates, in spite of increasing demand for them, fueled by delays in student visa processing, limited access to educational loans, and travel embargos. Start with data As weâve seen, data is the fuel that powers machine learning engines, which is why data preparation is so important when building a model. The expression âthe more the merrier'' holds true in machine learning, which typically performs better with larger, high-quality datasets. With Akkio, you can connect this data from a number of sources, such as a CSV file, an Excel sheet, or from Snowflake (a data warehouse) or Salesforce (a Customer Relationship Manager). For example, suppose youâd like to use AI to score sales leads . If your business uses Salesforce, you can directly connect your sales dataset, and then select a column that relates to whether or not a deal was closed. Many smaller sales teams keep it simple, using Google Sheets or Excel to organize lead data. Both of these sources can be easily connected to Akkio as well, and youâd build the model in the same wayâby selecting the column youâd like to predict. On the other end of the spectrum, some larger firms use Snowflake for handling massive amounts of sales data, which can be easily integrated with Akkio as well. Train a model Weâve explored how machine learning models are mathematical algorithms that are used to find patterns in data. To train a machine learning model, you need a high-quality dataset that is representative of the problem youâre trying to solve. Letâs walk through a practical example. In Akkio, you can train a model by hitting âAdd Stepâ once a dataset is connected, and then âPredict.â Then, simply select the column to predict.Â Generally speaking, there are two kinds of models you can train: Classification models and regression models.Â A few examples of classification include fraud prediction, lead conversion prediction, and churn prediction. The output values of these examples are all âYesâ or âNo,â or similar such classes. On the other hand, regression models are used to predict a range of output variables, such as sales revenue or costs. After selecting âPredict,â training either kind of model is the same: Youâll select the column name you want to predict, whether itâs called conversion, churn, attrition, fraud, or any other metric. You also have the option to select a âTraining Mode,â which ranges from 10 seconds of training time to 5 minutes, where longer training times may lead to more accurate models. Behind the scenes While the training process is done in just a couple clicks, a lot of work is done in the background. It starts with software engineering to lay the groundwork for the platform itself. Software engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software. Most of today's software development activities are performed by a team of engineers.Â But thatâs not all. DevOps is used to help bring AI applications to production. DevOps is a software development method that focuses on the collaboration between software developers and other IT professionals. It aims to shorten the time between the software's conception and its adoption by end users. In order to build the AI pattern recognition models themselves, a number of different approaches are used. Pattern recognition is the ability to identify a pattern in data and match that pattern in new data. This is a key part of machine learning, and it can be either supervised or unsupervised.Â The Bayesian approach to AI is a probabilistic approach to making decisions. Bayesian methods are used to estimate the probability of a hypothesis, based on prior knowledge and new evidence. Another technique is dimensionality reduction, a process that reduces the number of dimensions of a dataset by identifying which are important and removing those that are not. K-means clustering and PCA, or Principle Component Analysis, are two methods commonly used together. In order to group associated data points, k-means finds the partition in data, while PCA finds the cluster membership vector. Random forest is another common method. A random forest is a machine learning method that generates multiple decision trees on the same input features. The hierarchy of decision trees is built by randomly selecting observations to root each tree. Gradient descent is a commonly used technique in various model training methods. Itâs used to find the local minimum in a function through an iterative process of âdescending the gradientâ of error. These AI methods are often built with tools like TensorFlow, ONNX, and PyTorch. TensorFlow is an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence that provides a set of tools for data scientists and machine learning engineers to build and train neural nets. It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. ONNX is an open-source modeling language for neural networks that was created to make it easier for AI developers to transfer their algorithms between systems and applications. This open-source AI framework was made to be widely available to anyone who wants to use it. PyTorch is an open source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch. PyTorch provides GPU acceleration and can be used either as a command line tool or through Jupyter Notebooks. PyTorch has been designed with a Python-first approach, allowing researchers to prototype models quickly. All of these model training processes are iterative, and many technical model training considerations are accounted for.Â One of these concerns is overfitting, which happens when a model tries to predict every individual input that it might get instead of just being able to predict certain patterns in the data.Â There are best practices that can be followed when training machine learning models in order to prevent these mistakes from happening. One of these best practices is regularization, which helps with overfitting by shrinking parameters (e.g., weights) until they make less impact on predictions. An additional best practice for successful training is using cross validation. Another concern is called the âcurse of dimensionality.â This happens when the number of inputs to a model gets too large for it to work properly, especially if many inputs are not statistically relevant to the outcome being predicted. A way to get around this is by simplifying or reducing the number of features or dimensions being used in order to make more accurate predictions - this is known as âdimensionality reduction.â One technique for dimensionality reduction is called Principal Component Analysis, or PCA. PCA turns a large amount of data into a few categories that are most useful for describing the properties of what youâre measuring. Evaluate model performance Not all machine learning models are made equal. Thereâs a popular saying in the AI world: âGarbage in, garbage out.â If low-quality data is used to build a machine learning model, then the model will generate low-quality predictions as well. There are a number of metrics you can use to evaluate the performance of a model. After making any model in Akkio, you get a model report, including a âPrediction Qualityâ section. Classification If youâve built a classification model, the quality metrics include percentage accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as the number of values predicted correctly and incorrectly for each class.Â Here are what these fields mean: Accuracy: Accuracy measures how often a prediction is correct, and is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions. Precision: Precision is the fraction of true positives out of the predicted positives. This is useful to consider when the cost of a false positive is high, such as in email spam detection. If an important email is incorrectly classified as spam, youâll lose important information. Recall: Recall is how many of the actual positives your model captures. This is useful to consider when the cost of a false negative is high, such as in malignant cancer prediction. F1 Score: The F1 score combines precision and recall into one metric and weights them, in order to balance the consideration of false positives and false negatives. Forecasting Because forecasting is used to predict a range of values, as opposed to a limited set of classes, there are different evaluation metrics to consider. After building a forecasting model, such as for cost modeling, youâll see an RMSE value and a field called âusually within.âÂ RMSE stands for Root Mean Square Error, which is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). The âusually withinâ field provides values that are simpler to understand in context, such as a cost model thatâs âusually withinâ $40 of the actual value. Deploy a model and make predictions VentureBeat reports that 87% machine learning models never make it into production. This is affirmed by a separate study indicating that just 14.6% of firms have deployed AI capabilities in production. We canât blame them. AI is a difficult task, and many companies try to reinvent the wheel by building their own data pipelines, model infrastructure, and more. At the same time, a McKinsey survey found that just 8% of respondents engaged in effective scaling practices. What this means is that many firms are building models, but are unable to deploy them, particularly at scale. With Akkio, businesses can effortlessly deploy models at scale in a range of environments. More technical users can use our API to serve predictions in practically any setting, while business users can deploy predictions directly in Salesforce, Snowflake, Google Sheets, and thousands of other apps with the power of Zapier. The term API is short for ""application programming interface,"" and it's a way for software to talk to other software. APIs are often used in cloud computing and IoT applications to connect systems, services, and devices. By querying Akkioâs API endpoints, businesses can send data to any model and get a prediction back in the form of a JSON data structure.Â For context, data structures refer to the way data is organized in a computer program. Data structures are built on two concepts: data types and data manipulation. Data types define the type of data in the structure, such as number, word, or image. Data manipulation defines how data is organized in the structure, such as linear, hierarchical, or tree. Models can even be deployed via web app to instantly get a URL to share with others. When you hit âDeployâ for a web app, youâll also get an iFrame embed (an inline frame), which is an HTML tag that can be embedded in any site.Â Users who deploy models can take advantage of cloud storage that scales to accommodate unlimited data uploads. AI is the next growth engine for cloud storage, with a massive annual growth rate. Further, these cloud servers are home to huge Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) clusters. AI algorithms that require a lot of mathematical calculations, such as neural networks, are well suited to GPU processing, such that cloud servers enable unlimited scalability of model predictions. Continuous Learning (what it is and why it matters)Â The importance of continuous learning in machine learning cannot be overstated. Continuous learning is the process of improving a system's performance by updating the system as new data becomes available. Continuous learning is the key to creating machine learning models that will be used years down the road. The process of updating a system with new data, or âlearningâ, is something that is done by people all the time. Continuous learning seeks to replicate this process in a machine. The key to building robust models that continue to be valuable in the future is to learn from new information as it becomes available. This would allow the machine to adjust its behavior accordingly when responding to new information, just like humans do. The more data a machine has, the more effective it will be at responding to new information. The extent to which continuous learning is applied will help determine how intelligent the system is and how well it responds to new situations. ML Operations Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is the compendium of services and tools that an organization uses to help train and deploy machine learning models.Â MLOps services help businesses and developers to get started with AI, with service offerings that include data preparation, model training, hyper-parameter tuning, model deployment, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance. Organizations with a large training pipeline need MLOps to efficiently scale training and production operations. These services allow developers to tap into the power of AI without having to invest as much in the infrastructure and expertise that are required to build AI systems. With Akkio, machine learning operations are standardized, streamlined, and automated in the background, allowing non-technical users to have access to the same caliber of features as industry experts. Data Preparation To recap, data preparation is the process of transforming raw data into a format that is appropriate for modeling, which makes it a key component of machine learning operations. This process typically includes splitting the data into parts for training and validation, and normalizing the data. This means randomly splitting the data into a set of two subsets, known as âtraining dataâ and âtesting dataâ (this is called stratified sampling). The first subset is then trained to try and find patterns in the data, but the model doesn't know what's coming next. The second subset is used as new input the AI has never seen before, which helps better predict outcomes. That way, when you create predictions on new inputs using this model, they're more accurate, because you're using examples that have not already been seen by the model.Â Data preparation can also include normalizing values within one column so that each value falls between 0 and 1 or belongs to a particular range of values (a process known as binning). For example, if someone were providing demographic information about people who visit their website and are able to purchase goods online, it would be helpful to split them into male or female; under 18 or over 18 years old; and so on, in order to classify their behavior while browsing based on these groupings. Model Training The training phase is where machine learning models are generated out of algorithms. The algorithm may determine which features of the data are most predictive for the desired outcome. This phase can be divided into several sub-steps, including feature selection, model training, and hyperparameter optimization. The goal of feature selection is to find a subset of features that still captures variability in the data, while excluding those features that are irrelevant or have a weak correlation with the desired outcome. Machine learning algorithms are supported by inferential statistics to ""train"" the model, such that it is able to make ""inferences"" about new data.Â Machine learning will often operate via a feedback loop whereby input data starts with an empty algorithm, which then finds patterns in that data over the course of multiple iterations. That information is fed back into the algorithm which modifies its parameters and goes through another iteration for refinement, until the optimal model is found. Finally, hyperparameter optimization determines what set of hyperparameter settings should be used based on some criteria, such as cost or computational efficiency. Factors to consider when evaluating model hyperparameter tunings can include:Â Accuracy vs speed tradeoffÂ The degree of robustness against overfitting and underfitting due to a large number of tunable parameters vs accuracy tradeoff Model Deployment The process of deploying an AI model is often the most difficult step of MLOps, which explains why so many AI models are built, but not deployed.Â There are a number of different considerations to plan for, including: How will data be queried? What product or service will the AI model be embedded into? How do we ensure that all pieces of the model will continue to work together as expected over time?Â These are just some of many questions which must be addressed before deployment. With Akkio, teams can deploy models without having to worry about these considerations, and can select their deployment environment in clicks. Nowadays, there are many creative ways to deploy AI. For instance, you can deploy models on mobile phones with limited bandwidth, or even offline-capable AI servers. Offline AI is a model deployment option that can be used to serve predictions locally, or âat the edge,â for use-cases like smart CCTVs that might be in a wireless dead zone, or even AI-powered medical diagnostic apps that deal with sensitive health data.Â Summary Building and deploying any type of AI model can seem daunting, but with no-code AI tools like Akkio, itâs truly effortless. As long as teams have the data, which can come from tools like Salesforce, Snowflake, or even just a Google Sheets file, they can effortlessly train and deploy intelligent models, for everything from churn prediction to sales funnel optimization.

NEED FOR MACHINE LEARNING Press enter or click to view image in full size Goal of AI is to give cognitive skills to machines — the ability to see, hear, speak, read, understand, decide , just like humans. AI = GOAL To build machines with human-like intelligence. ML = TOOL To teach machines by learning from data. Press enter or click to view image in full size Machine Learning is a subfield of AI that allows machines to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of hard-coding rules, we give the machine data + algorithms → and it finds the rules itself. Why Inject Human-Like Cognitive Skills into Machines? Humans can’t process gigabytes of visual, audio, or text data in milliseconds . Machines can. Machines with cognitive skills can do things humans can’t : Analyze billions of data points. See patterns invisible to humans (e.g., early cancer signs in scans) Chat in 100 languages instantly. Operate 24/7 without fatigue. Press enter or click to view image in full size Evolution of Machine Learning The Journey of Machine(Computers): From Calculation/Computation to Cognition/Intelligence The Era of Computation (1940s–1960s) : Computers were born to calculate what humans couldn’t compute fast enough. The Era of Data & Storage (1970s–2000s) : As information exploded, we needed computers to remember and manage our data. The Era of Intelligence (2010s–present) : Today, we need machines that can see, speak, listen, think — and act intelligently. As the world evolved, so did the problems we needed to solve: Understanding language Driving cars Diagnosing diseases Detecting fraud These problems are not just about numbers — they require perception, learning, decision-making — i.e., cognitive skills . Press enter or click to view image in full size DATA is the solution and Data is the key. We can generate insights and patterns from data to solve real-world problems. Operational Issues — such as detecting fraud, identifying bottlenecks, or predicting maintenance needs. Social and Environmental Issues — like predicting traffic congestion, managing energy usage, or monitoring pollution. Healthcare Challenges — diagnosing diseases, personalizing treatments, forecasting outbreaks. Press enter or click to view image in full size Data generation is currently skyrocketing. With availability of so much data, it’s finally possible to build predictive models that can study and analyze complex data to find useful insight and deliver more accurate results. We use patterns in data to understand what’s happening , why it’s happening , and what might happen next , so we can take the right actions . Press enter or click to view image in full size Machine Learning is the process — the methodology we use to train a machine to learn from data and become capable of making decisions on its own. ML is a process that includes: Feeding data to the system Applying algorithms to learn from that data Creating a model that represents the learned knowledge Using the model to make predictions or decisions on new inputs Press enter or click to view image in full size Machine Learning improves decision making, uncover pattern and trends in data and performs computation on data. Process of Machine Learning Machine Learning Process The machine learning process involves building a Predictive Model that can be used to find a solution for a Problem Statement. 1. Define the Data Objective (Problem Understanding) Before jumping into code or data, you need to clearly define what problem you’re trying to solve . What decision are we trying to automate or support? What is the target (output) we want to predict? Example: In an e-commerce company, we want to predict whether a customer will cancel an order based on their past behavior and current order details. Predictive Variable (a.k.a. Feature, Independent Variable): These are the inputs — the variables that you feed into the model to make a prediction. They are also called features or explanatory variables . Response Variable (a.k.a. Target, Dependent Variable): This is the output you want to predict. It’s the goal of the prediction task. Output (target variable): Order Canceled: Yes or No. Clearly identifying the response variable helps you define the ML problem type :- If response is numeric → Regression If response is category/label → Classification Press enter or click to view image in full size 2. Data Gathering (Collecting Raw Data) What kind of data is needed to solve the problem? Collect the data that might help solve the problem. This could be from databases, logs, sensors, files, or APIs. If available, from where i can get this data? How can i get this data? Download data or Web Scrapping? Example: From your order cancellation problem, gather- a) Customer profiles, b) Order history, c) Product data, d) Time of order, e)Delivery location, f) Feedback or complaints. Note : Data can be structured (tables), semi-structured (JSON), or unstructured (text, images). 3. Preparing the Data (Cleaning & Preprocessing) Raw data is messy! This step ensures your data is clean, complete, and usable . Data cleaning involves getting rid of inconsistencies in data such as missing values or redundant values. Tasks include:- 1)Handling missing values, 2)Removing duplicates, 3)Encoding categorical variables (e.g., “Male”, “Female” → 0, 1), 4)Normalizing or scaling numbers and 5)Creating features from raw columns (e.g., extracting day of week from a timestamp). Example : If some orders have no delivery location, you can- Drop those records Or fill them with the average location of similar users. 4. Data Exploration (EDA — Exploratory Data Analysis) Data exploration involves understanding the patterns and trends in data. At this stage all the useful insight are drawn and correlations between the variables are understood. Correlation simply means: How strongly does one variable move (increase or decrease) when another variable changes? Understand your data using visuals and statistics . This helps you: Identify patterns Spot outliers Understand feature relationships with the target. It helps us answer questions like: If the size of a house increases , does the price usually increase too? If a person’s age increases , does their spending on fashion decrease? Example: 1) Use plots like histograms, scatter plots, box plots. 2)Correlation heatmaps to see how features relate to the output and 3)You might find that: “Most canceled orders happen in remote locations or during holidays” Goal: Gain insights to improve model performance and decide which features matter. 5. Building the Model (Training) At this stage a predictive models is built by using ML algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees etc. Choose an ML algorithm, split your data into training and testing sets , and use the training data to create a model . Example: Algorithm- Logistic Regression (for Yes/No prediction). In this stage, we split our dataset into two parts- Training Dataset: Train on 80% of data to learn patterns. Testing Dataset: Test on 20% to evaluate performance. In this customer order example, output is based on categorical variable i.e. either order cancelled or not cancelled. In this case we use- classification algorithm. 6. Model Evaluation and Optimization (Validation & Tuning) Evaluate how well your model performs on unseen data. The efficiency of the model is evaluated and any further improvements in the model are implemented. Key metrics : Accuracy, Precision & Recall (for imbalance), F1 Score and AUC-ROC. The testing dataset is used to check the efficiency of the model and how accurately it can predict the outcome. Example : Your model has 92% accuracy — sounds good. But precision = 60% and recall = 40%? Not good for fraud detection or healthcare. Tune it. Further improvement in the model are done by using techniques like: Cross-validation, Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search) and Feature selection. 7. Making Predictions (Deployment & Inference) Now your trained model is ready to predict on new, real-world data — make it available as a service or embed it in an app. Example: When a new customer places an order, your deployed model predicts- “There is a 72% chance the order will be canceled — flag it for manual review.” You can retrain the model regularly with fresh data — this is model lifecycle management . Press enter or click to view image in full size reference Types of Machine Learning Supervised Learning Supervised Learning is a technique in which we train or teach the machine using data which is well labelled. Press enter or click to view image in full size Labelled Output Real-World Example: Loan Approval Prediction Data : Customer age, income, credit score, job type Label (output) : Loan approved = Yes / No Learning Type : Supervised Algorithm : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Use Case : Bank wants to automate and speed up loan approval decisions Model Usage : When a new application comes in, the model predicts whether the customer is eligible for a loan. Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning is a branch of machine learning that combines supervised and unsupervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data to train artificial intelligence (AI) models. Real-World Example: Medical Image Classification Data : 10,000 X-ray scans, but only 500 are labeled “disease” or “healthy” Learning Type : Semi-Supervised Algorithm : Self-training, Label propagation, Semi-supervised SVM Use Case : Reduce cost/time of expert labeling by training model with partial labels Model Usage : Model learns from 500 labeled X-rays and improves itself using patterns in the remaining 9,500 unlabeled ones. Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is unlabeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without any guidance. Press enter or click to view image in full size GOAL: Discover hidden patterns or groupings. Real-World Example: Customer Segmentation in E-commerce Data : Purchase frequency, cart size, time spent, returns No labels given — just behaviors Learning Type : Unsupervised Algorithm : K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN Use Case : E-commerce company wants to group users into meaningful segments for targeted marketing Model Usage : “Budget Buyers”, “Frequent Shoppers”, “Luxury Spenders” — different ads for each segment. Reinforcement learning Reinforcement Learning is a part of machine learning where an agent is put in an environment and he learns to behave in this environment by performing certain actions and observing the rewards which it gets from those actions. Press enter or click to view image in full size Learn by interacting with an environment and getting rewards/punishments. Real-World Example: Self-driving Car Navigation Data : Car’s camera feed, speed, GPS, etc. No fixed labeled dataset — the agent learns by driving Learning Type : Reinforcement Algorithm : Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient Use Case : Learn how to drive, change lanes, stop, avoid crashes Model Usage : Car gets +10 points for staying in lane, -50 for hitting a barrier — it learns the best way to drive safely. Press enter or click to view image in full size Self-Supervised Learning (used in LLMs like BERT, GPT) Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm where models learn from unlabeled data by automatically generating their own labels or supervisory signals. Instead of relying on manually labeled datasets, SSL algorithms define pretext tasks that allow the model to learn meaningful representations of the data by inferring relationships or patterns within the unlabeled input. Data : Text data (millions of documents) Learning Type : Self-supervised Algorithm : Transformers Use Case : Predict missing words, next sentences (e.g., “The capital of France is ___”) Model Usage : Models like ChatGPT are trained to understand and generate natural human-like responses from context. Press enter or click to view image in full size ✅ Start with data → define the objective → choose the learning type → select the algorithm → train the model → use it for predictions/decisions. In Machine Learning all the problems are classified into three types- All machine learning problems are grouped into three major types based on what kind of question you’re trying to answer — and that defines how the model will learn and predict . Press enter or click to view image in full size Regression — Predicting a Continuous Value. Question being asked: “How much?”, “What is the number?” Real-World Example: Predict House Prices. Classification — Predicting a Category Question being asked: “Which category does it belong to?” Real-World Example: Spam Email Detection. Clustering — Grouping Similar Things Question being asked: “What are the natural groups or segments?” Real-World Example: Customer Segmentation in Marketing. Machine Learning problems are grouped as: Regression → Predicts numbers (e.g., how much) Classification → Predicts labels (e.g., yes/no) Clustering → Groups data (e.g., who is similar to whom) All the problems which you gave to your machine learning model will fall into one of these categories. Press enter or click to view image in full size source Machine Learning Models In Machine Learning, once your data and problem are defined, the next big decision is how to build the model . There are three main types of models that you can use — and each is trained using one or more of the five learning types: supervised , unsupervised , semi-supervised , reinforcement , and self-supervised learning . Press enter or click to view image in full size 1. Pre-trained Models These are models that have already been trained on massive datasets by researchers or companies. They are trained on general tasks (like predicting the next word or filling in blanks) and can be used directly for many common problems. These models are usually trained using self-supervised learning (no manual labels needed). Examples: BERT , GPT , RoBERTa , ANDRLM , CLIP , DINO Used in: NLP, speech, vision, recommendation systems You can use them as-is or fine-tune them further. Example: ChatGPT is a pre-trained model built using self-supervised learning on a huge corpus of internet text. 2. Fine-tuned Models This means you take a pre-trained model and then train it further on your own labeled dataset . This process adapts the general intelligence of the model to your specific use case. Fine-tuning always uses supervised learning because it requires labeled data. You provide task-specific examples like “This review is positive” or “This document is about sports.” Examples: a) Fine-tuning BERT to classify legal documents b) Fine-tuning GPT to answer questions in healthcare Example: You fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on 1,000 customer reviews labeled “positive” or “negative” — now it works as a product review classifier. 3. Custom-Trained Models (From Scratch) In some cases, you may want to build a model entirely from the ground up using your own algorithms and data. You can use any type of learning here — depending on the problem: Supervised learning → Predict loan approvals Unsupervised learning → Cluster customers Semi-supervised learning → Use a few labels to train on massive unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning → Teach a robot to walk or a bot to play chess Self-supervised learning → Train a language model from text data with no labels Custom training gives full control but requires more resources, time, and data. Example: A drone startup might train a reinforcement learning model from scratch to learn how to fly through a maze by trial and error. Summary — How It All Connects ✅ Pre-trained models → Trained using self-supervised learning ✅ Fine-tuned models → Adapted using supervised learning ✅ Custom models → Can use any of the five learning types based on the goal Press enter or click to view image in full size The Value and Impact of Machine Learning “The ultimate goal of Machine Learning is not just to create a model — but to solve real-world problems intelligently, efficiently, and at scale.” What Kind of Problems Does Machine Learning Solve?

It may be easiest to describe what it is by listing its more concrete components: Data exploration & analysis . Included here: Pandas; NumPy; SciPy; a helping hand from Python’s Standard Library. Data visualization .  A pretty self-explanatory name.  Taking data and turning it into something colorful. Included here: Matplotlib; Seaborn; Datashader; others . Classical machine learning .  Conceptually, we could define this as any supervised or unsupervised learning task that is not deep learning (see below).  Scikit-learn is far-and-away the go-to tool for implementing classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, while StatsModels is less actively developed but still has a number of useful features. Included here: Scikit-Learn, StatsModels. Deep learning .  This is a subset of machine learning that is seeing a renaissance, and is commonly implemented with Keras, among other libraries.  It has seen monumental improvements over the last ~5 years, such as AlexNet in 2012, which was the first design to incorporate consecutive convolutional layers. Included here: Keras, TensorFlow, and a whole host of others. Data storage and big data frameworks .  Big data is best defined as data that is either literally too large to reside on a single machine, or can’t be processed in the absence of a distributed environment.  The Python bindings to Apache technologies play heavily here. Apache Spark; Apache Hadoop; HDFS; Dask; h5py/pytables. Odds and ends .  Includes subtopics such as natural language processing, and image manipulation with libraries such as OpenCV. Included here: nltk; Spacy; OpenCV/cv2; scikit-image; Cython.

What is the difference between machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI? What are the challenges of deep learning? What are the benefits of generative AI and deep learning in the cloud? How can AWS help with your generative AI and deep learning requirements? What is deep learning in AI? Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) method that teaches computers to process data in a way inspired by the human brain. Deep learning models can recognize complex pictures, text, sounds, and other data patterns to produce accurate insights and predictions. You can use deep learning methods to automate tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as describing images or transcribing a sound file into text. Watch our introduction to deep learning What is deep generative learning? Deep generative learning is deep learning that focuses on creating new output from learned input. Traditionally, deep learning focused on identifying relationships between data. Deep learning models were trained with large amounts of data to recognize patterns in the data set. Deep generative learning adds generation to pattern recognition. Such models look for data patterns and then create their own unique patterns. For example, they can analyze the text in several books and then use the information to generate new sentences and paragraphs not found in the original books. Deep generative learning is the basis of modern generative AI and foundation models . These models use deep learning technologies at scale, trained on vast data, to perform complex tasks like answering questions, creating images from text, and writing content. Watch an introductory video to foundation models Why is deep learning important? Deep learning technology drives many artificial intelligence applications used in everyday products, such as the following: Chatbots and code generators Digital assistants Voice-activated television remotes Fraud detection Automatic facial recognition It is also a critical component of technologies like self-driving cars, virtual reality, and more. Businesses use deep learning models to analyze data and make predictions in various applications. What are deep learning use cases? Deep learning has several use cases in automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, electronics, medical research, and other fields. Self-driving cars use deep learning models for object detection. Defense systems use deep learning to flag areas of interest in satellite images. Medical image analysis uses deep learning to detect cancer cells for medical diagnosis. Factories use deep learning applications to detect when people or objects are within an unsafe distance of machines. These various use cases of deep learning can be grouped into five broad categories: computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), recommendation engines, and generative AI. Computer vision Computer vision automatically extracts information and insights from images and videos. Deep learning techniques to comprehend images in the same way that humans do. Computer vision has several applications, such as the following: Content moderation to automatically remove unsafe or inappropriate content from image and video archives Facial recognition to identify faces and recognize attributes like open eyes, glasses, and facial hair Image classification to identify brand logos, clothing, safety gear, and other image details Speech recognition Deep learning models can analyze human speech despite varying speech patterns, pitch, tone, language, and accent. Virtual assistants such as Amazon Alexa, text-to-speech , and speech-to-text software use speech recognition to do the following tasks: Assist call center agents and automatically classify calls. Convert clinical conversations into documentation in real-time. Accurately subtitle videos and meeting recordings for a wider content reach. Convert scripts to prompts for intelligent voice assistance. Natural language processing Computers use deep learning algorithms to gather insights and meaning from text data and documents. This ability to process natural, human-created text has several use cases, including: Automated virtual agents and chatbots Automatic summarization of documents or news articles Business intelligence analysis of long-form documents, such as emails and forms Indexing of key phrases that indicate sentiment, such as positive and negative comments on social media Recommendation engines Applications can use deep learning methods to track user activity and develop personalized recommendations . They can analyze users' behavior and help them discover new products or services. For example, Recommend personalized videos and content. Recommend customized products and services. Filter search results to highlight relevant content based on user location and behavior Generative AI Generative AI applications can create new content and communicate with end users more sophisticatedly. They can assist in automating complex workflows, brainstorming ideas, and intelligent knowledge searches. For example, with generative AI tools like Amazon Q Business and Amazon Q Developer , users can Ask natural language questions and get summarized answers from multiple internal knowledge sources. Get code suggestions and automatic code scanning and upgrades. Create new documents, emails, and other marketing content faster. How does deep learning work? Deep learning models are neural networks designed after the human brain. A human brain contains millions of interconnected biological neurons that work together to learn and process information. Similarly, artificial neurons are software modules called nodes that use mathematical calculations to process data. Deep learning neural networks, or artificial neural networks, comprise many layers of artificial neurons that work together to solve complex problems. The components of a deep neural network are the following. Input layer An artificial neural network has several nodes that input data into it. These nodes make up the system's input layer. Hidden layer The input layer processes and passes the data to layers further in the neural network. These hidden layers process information at different levels, adapting their behavior as they receive new information. Deep learning networks have hundreds of hidden layers that they can use to analyze a problem from several different angles. For example, if you were given an image of an unknown animal that you had to classify, you would compare it with animals you already know. For example, you would look at the shape of its eyes and ears, size, number of legs, and fur pattern. You would try to identify patterns, such as the following: The animal has hooves, so it could be a cow or deer. The animal has cat eyes, so it could be a wild cat. The hidden layers in deep neural networks work in the same way. If a deep learning algorithm tries to classify an animal image, each of its hidden layers processes a different animal feature and tries to categorize it accurately. Output layer The output layer consists of the nodes that output the data. Deep learning models that output ""yes"" or ""no"" answers have only two nodes in the output layer. On the other hand, those that output a wider range of answers have more nodes. Generative AI has a sophisticated output layer to generate new data that matches patterns in its training data set. What is the difference between machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI? The terms machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI indicate a progression in neural network technology. Machine learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning . Deep learning algorithms emerged to make traditional machine learning techniques more efficient. Traditional machine learning methods require significant human effort to train the software. For example, in animal image recognition, you need to do the following: Manually label hundreds of thousands of animal images. Make the machine learning algorithms process those images. Test those algorithms on a set of unknown images. Identify why some results are inaccurate. Improve the dataset by labeling new images to improve result accuracy. This process is called supervised learning. In supervised learning, result accuracy improves only with a broad and sufficiently varied dataset. For instance, the algorithm might accurately identify black cats but not white cats because the training dataset had more images of black cats. In that case, you would need more labeled data of white cat images to train the machine learning models again. Benefits of deep learning over machine learning A deep learning network has the following benefits over traditional machine learning. Efficient processing of unstructured data Machine learning methods find unstructured data, such as text documents, challenging to process because the training dataset can have infinite variations. On the other hand, deep learning models can comprehend unstructured data and make general observations without manual feature extraction. For instance, a neural network can recognize that these two different input sentences have the same meaning: Can you tell me how to make the payment? How do I transfer money? Hidden relationships and pattern discovery A deep learning application can analyze large amounts of data more deeply and reveal new insights for which it might not have been trained. For example, consider a deep learning model trained to analyze consumer purchases. The model has data only for the items you have already purchased. However, the artificial neural network can suggest new items you haven't bought by comparing your buying patterns to those of similar customers. Unsupervised learning Deep learning models can learn and improve over time based on user behavior. They do not require large variations of labeled datasets. For example, consider a neural network that automatically corrects or suggests words by analyzing your typing behavior. Let's assume it was trained in English and can spell-check English words. However, if you frequently type non-English words, such as danke, the neural network automatically learns and autocorrects these words too. Volatile data processing Volatile datasets have large variations. One example is loan repayment amounts in a bank. A deep learning neural network can categorize and sort that data by analyzing financial transactions and flagging some for fraud detection. Learn more about deep learning vs. machine learning Generative AI Generative AI took the neural networks of machine learning and deep learning to the next level. While machine learning and deep learning focus on prediction and pattern recognition, generative AI produces unique outputs based on the patterns it detects. Generative AI technology is built on transformer architecture that combines several different neural networks to combine data patterns in unique ways. Deep learning networks first convert text, images, and other data into mathematical abstractions and then reconvert them into meaningful new patterns. What are the challenges of deep learning? Challenges in implementing deep learning and generative AI are given below. Large quantities of high-quality data When you train them on large amounts of high-quality data, deep learning algorithms give better results. Outliers or mistakes in your input dataset can significantly affect the deep learning process. For instance, in our animal image example, the deep learning model might classify an airplane as a turtle if the dataset accidentally introduces non-animal images. To avoid such inaccuracies, you must clean and process large amounts of data before training deep learning models. The input data preprocessing requires large amounts of data storage capacity. Large processing power Deep learning algorithms are compute-intensive and require infrastructure with sufficient compute capacity to function properly. Otherwise, they take a long time to process results. What are the benefits of generative AI and deep learning in the cloud? Running generative AI and deep learning on cloud infrastructure helps you design, develop, and train applications faster. Speed You can train generative AI and deep learning models faster by using clusters of GPUs and CPUs to perform the complex mathematical operations that your neural networks require. You can then deploy these models to process large amounts of data and produce increasingly relevant results. Scalability With the wide range of on-demand resources available through the cloud, you can access virtually unlimited hardware resources to tackle AI deep learning models of any size. Your neural networks can take advantage of multiple processors to seamlessly and efficiently distribute workloads across different processor types and quantities. Tools You can access AI and deep learning tools like notebooks, debuggers, profilers, pipelines, AIOps, and more. You can work with existing generative AI models from within the cloud as a service without requiring infrastructure to host the model. Teams can start with generative AI and deep learning applications even with limited knowledge and training. How can AWS help with your generative AI and deep learning requirements?

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide When you built your website, you likely created it with your users in mind, trying to make it easy
  for them to find and explore your content. One of those users is a search engine, which helps
  people discover your content. SEO—short for search engine optimization—is about
  helping search engines understand your content, and helping users find your site and make a
  decision about whether they should visit your site through a search engine. The Search Essentials outline the most important elements of
  what makes your website eligible to appear on Google Search. While there's no guarantee that any
  particular site will be added to Google's index, sites that follow the Search Essentials are
  more likely to show up in Google's search results . SEO is about taking the next step and working on improving your site's presence in Search . This guide will walk you through some
  of the most common and effective improvements you can do on your site. There are no secrets here that'll automatically rank your site first in Google (sorry!). In fact
  some of the suggestions might not even apply to your business, but following the best practices
  will hopefully make it easier for search engines (not just Google) to crawl, index, and understand
  your content. How does Google Search work? Google is a fully automated search engine that uses programs called crawlers to explore the web
  constantly, looking for pages to add to our index. You usually don't need to do anything except
  publish your site on the web. In fact, the vast majority of sites listed in our results are found
  and added automatically as we crawl the web. If you're hungry for more, we have documentation
  about how Google discovers, crawls, and serves web pages . Short on time or not feeling adventurous? You might consider hiring a professional. Here's what to consider . How long until I see impact in search results? Every change you make will take some time to be reflected on Google's end. Some changes might take
  effect in a few hours, others could take several months. In general, you likely want to wait a few
  weeks to assess whether your work had beneficial effects in Google Search results. Keep in mind
  that not all changes you make to your website will result in noticeable impact in search results;
  if you're not satisfied with your results and your business strategies allow it, try
  iterating with the changes and see if they make a difference. Help Google find your content Before you actually do anything mentioned in this section, check if Google has already found your
  content (maybe you don't need to do anything!). Try searching on Google for your site with the site: search operator .
  If you see results pointing to your site, you're in the index. For example, a search for site:wikipedia.org returns these results .
  If you don't see your site, check out the technical requirements to make sure there's nothing technically preventing your site from showing in Google Search, and
  then come back here. Google primarily finds pages through links from other pages it already crawled. In many cases,
  these are other websites that are linking to your pages. Other sites linking to you is something
  that happens naturally over time, and you can also encourage people to discover your content by promoting your site . If you're open to a little technical challenge, you could also submit a sitemap —which is a
  file that contains all the URLs on your site that you care about. Some content management systems
  (CMS) may even do this automatically for you. However this isn't required, and you should first
  focus on making sure people know about your site . Check if Google can see your page the same way a user does When Google crawls a page, it should ideally see the page the same way an average user does .
  For this, Google needs to be able to access the same resources as the user's browser. If your site
  is hiding important components that make up your website (like CSS and JavaScript ), Google might
  not be able to understand your pages, which means they might not show up in search results or rank
  well for the terms you're targeting. If your pages have different information depending on the user's physical location, make sure
  you're satisfied with the information that Google sees from its crawler's location, which is generally
  the US. To check how Google sees your page, use the URL Inspection Tool in Search Console . Don't want a page in Google's search results? It might be important for you to opt out your site as a whole or sections of it from appearing in
  search results. For example, you might not want your posts about your new embarrassing haircut to
  show up in search results. Google supports various ways that lets you opt out of crawling and
  indexing of your URLs. If you need to block some files, directories, or even your whole site from
  Google Search, check out our guide about ways to prevent content from appearing in search results . Organize your site When you're setting up or redoing your site, it can be good to organize it in a logical way because it
  can help search engines and users understand how your pages relate to the rest of your site. Don't
  drop everything and start reorganizing your site right now though: while these suggestions can be
  helpful long term (especially if you're working on a larger website), search engines will likely
  understand your pages as they are right now, regardless of how your site is organized. Use descriptive URLs Parts of the URL can be displayed in search results as breadcrumbs, so users can also use the URLs
  to understand whether a result will be useful for them. An illustration that shows a text result in Google Search with callouts that label specific visible URL visual elements, including the domain and breadcrumb Domain Breadcrumb Google learns breadcrumbs automatically based on the words in the URL, but you can also influence
  them with structured data if you
  like a technical challenge. Try to include words in the URL that may be useful for users; for
  example: https://www.example.com/pets/cats.html A URL that only contains random identifiers is less helpful for users; for example: https://www.example.com/2/6772756D707920636174 Group topically similar pages in directories If you have more than a few thousand URLs on your site, how you organize your content may have
  effects on how Google crawls and indexes your site. Specifically, using directories (or folders)
  to group similar topics can help Google learn how often the URLs in individual directories
  change. For example, consider the following URLs: https://www.example.com/policies/return-policy.html https://www.example.com/promotions/new-promos.html The content in the policies directory seldomly changes, however the content in the promotions directory likely changes very often. Google can learn this information
  and crawl the different directories at different frequencies. To learn more about search-friendly
  site structures, check out our guide for ecommerce sites ,
  for which a good URL structure is more important as they tend to be larger. Reduce duplicate content Some websites show the same content under different URLs, which is called duplicate content .
  Search engines choose a single URL (the canonical URL) to show users, per piece of content. Having duplicate content on your site is not a violation of our spam policies, but it can be a bad
  user experience and search engines might waste crawling resources on URLs that you don't even care
  about. If you're feeling adventurous, it's worth figuring out if you can specify a canonical version for your pages. But if you don't canonicalize your URLs yourself, Google will try to automatically
  do it for you. When working on canonicalization, try to ensure that each piece of content on your site is only
  accessible through one individual URL; having two pages that contain the same
  information about your promotions can be a confusing user experience (for example, people
  might wonder which is the right page, and whether there's a difference between the two). If you have multiple pages that have the same information, try setting up a redirect from non-preferred URLs to a
   URL that best represents that information. If you can't redirect, use the rel=""canonical"" link element instead. But again, don't worry too much about this;
   search engines can generally figure this out for you on their own most of the time. Make your site interesting and useful Creating content that people find compelling and useful will likely influence your website's presence in search
  results more than any of the other suggestions in this guide. While ""compelling and useful content"" can
  mean different things to different people, content like this generally shares some common attributes,
  such as: The text is easy-to-read and well organized : Write content naturally and make sure the
    content is well written, easy to follow, and free of spelling and grammatical mistakes. Break
    up long content into paragraphs and sections, and provide headings to help users navigate your
    pages. The content is unique :
    When you're writing new content, don't copy others' content in part or in its entirety: create
    the content yourself based on what you know about the topic. Don't just rehash what others
    already published. The content is up-to-date : Check in on previously published content and update it as
    needed, or even delete it if it's not relevant anymore. The content is helpful, reliable, and people-first : Be sure that you're writing content that your readers will find helpful and reliable. For
    example, providing expert or experienced sources can help people understand your articles' expertise. Expect your readers' search terms Think about the words that a user might search for to find a piece of your content. Users who know
  a lot about the topic might use different keywords in their search queries than someone who is new
  to the topic. For example, some users might search for ""charcuterie"", while others might search
  for ""cheese board"". Anticipating these differences in search behavior and writing with your
  readers in mind could produce positive effects on how your site performs in search results. However, don't worry if you don't anticipate every variation of how someone might seek your
  content. Google's language matching systems are sophisticated and can understand how your page
  relates to many queries, even if you don't explicitly use the exact terms in them. Avoid distracting advertisements While ads are a part of the internet and are meant to be seen by users, don't let them become
  overly distracting or prevent your users from reading your content. For example, advertisements,
  or interstitial pages (pages
  displayed before or after the content you're expecting) that make it difficult to use the website. Link to relevant resources Links are a great way to connect your users and search engines to other parts of your site, or
  relevant pages on other sites. In fact, the vast majority of the new pages Google finds every day
  are through links, making links a crucial resource you need to consider to help your pages be
  discovered by Google and potentially shown in search results. Additionally, links can also add
  value by connecting users (and Google) to another resource that corroborates what you're writing
  about. Write good link text Link text (also known as anchor text )  is the text part of a link that you can see.
   This text tells users and Google something about the page you're linking to. With appropriate anchor text ,
  users and search engines can easily understand what your linked pages contain before they visit. Link when you need to Links can provide more context on a topic, both for users and search engines, which may help
  demonstrate your knowledge on a topic. However when you're linking to pages outside of your
  control, for example content on other sites, make sure you trust the resource you're linking to.
  If you can't trust the content and you still want to link to them, add a nofollow or similar annotation to the link to avoid search engines associating your site with the site you're linking to. This
  helps avoid potential negative consequences in your rankings in Google Search. If you're accepting user-generated content on your site, such as forum posts or comments, make
  sure every link that's posted by users has a nofollow or similar annotation
  automatically added by your CMS. Since you're not creating the content in this case, you likely
  don't want your site to be blindly associated with the sites users are linking to. This can also
  help discourage spammers from abusing your website. Influence how your site looks in Google Search A typical Google Search results page consists of a few different visual elements that
  you can influence to help users decide whether they should visit your site through those search
  results. In this section, we're focusing on the title link and the snippet because
  these are the more visually significant elements. Influence your title links The title link is the headline part of the search result and it can help people decide
  which search result to click. There are a few sources that Google uses to generate this title
  link, including the words inside the <title> element (also called the title
  text) and other headings on the page. This title text can also be used for the title that's shown
  in browsers and bookmarks. An illustration of a text result in Google Search, with a highlighted box around the title link part How to make your own chili oil If you use a CMS , you might not need to do anything technical to your
  titles, beyond just focusing on writing good titles. Most CMSes can automatically turn the
  titles you write into a <title> element in the HTML. You can influence the title links in Search by writing good titles: a good title is unique to the
  page, clear and concise, and accurately describes the contents of the page. For example, your
  title could include the name of your website or business, other bits of important information like
  the physical location of the business, and maybe some information about what the particular page
  has to offer for users. Our documentation about title links has more tips about how to create good titles and how to influence your site's search results'
  title links. Control your snippets Below the title link, a search result typically has a description of the target page to help users
  decide whether they should click the search result. This is called a snippet . An illustration of a text result in Google Search, with a highlighted box around the snippet part Learn how to cook eggs with this complete guide in less
      than 5 minutes. We cover all the methods, including sunny side up, boiled, and poached. The snippet is sourced from the actual content of the page the search result is linking to, thus
  you have complete control over the words that can be used to generate the snippet. Occasionally
  the snippet may be sourced from the contents of the meta description tag, which is typically a
  succinct, one- or two-sentence summary of the page. A good meta description is short, unique to one
  particular page, and includes the most relevant points of the page. Check out our tips for writing good meta descriptions for
  more inspiration. Add images to your site, and optimize them Many people search visually, and images can be how people find your website for the first time.
  For example, if you have a recipe blog, people might find your content by searching for ""fruit
  tart recipes"" and browsing photos of various types of fruit tarts. As you add images to your site, make sure that people and search engines can find and understand them. Add high-quality images near relevant text When you use high quality images, you give users enough context and detail to decide which image
  best matches what they were looking for. For example, if people are looking for ""daisies"" and
  come across a rogue edelweiss in search results, a higher quality image would help them distinguish
  the type of flower. Use images that are sharp and clear, and place them near text that's relevant to the image. The
  text that's near images can help Google better understand what the image is about and what it
  means in context to your page. For example, if the page is reviewing yarn shops in London, then it would make sense to embed one
  of your photos of the yarn shop in the section that details the location, description, and review
  information for that yarn shop. This helps Google and users associate the image with text that
  provides more context to what the page is about. Add descriptive alt text to the image Alt text is a short, but descriptive piece of text that explains the relationship between the
  image and your content. It helps search engines understand what your image is about and the
  context of how your image relates to your page, so writing good alt text is quite important. You can add this to your HTML with the alt attribute of the img element, or your CMS may have an easy way to specify a description for an image
  when you're uploading it to your site. Learn more about how to write good alt text ,
  and how to add it to your images. Optimize your videos If your website includes pages that are primarily about individual videos, people may also be able
  to discover your site through video results in Google Search. Many of the best practices for
  images and text also apply to videos: Create high-quality video content, and embed the video on a standalone page, near text that's
    relevant to that video. Write descriptive text in the titles and description fields of a video (the title of a video
    is still a title, and so you can apply the best practices for writing titles here too). If your site is particularly video-focused, then continue reading about more things you can do to optimize your videos for search engines . Promote your website Effectively promoting your new content will lead to faster discovery by those who are interested
  in the same subject, and also by search engines. You can do this in many ways: Social media promotion Community engagement Advertisement, both offline and online Word of mouth, and many other methods One of the most effective and lasting ways is word of mouth: that is, people familiar with your site tell their friends about it, who in turn
  visit your site. This can take time, and usually you need to invest some time and effort in other
  practices first, such as community engagement. Our friends over at Google for Creators have excellent
  resources about building and engaging your audience . Putting effort into the offline promotion of your company or site can also be rewarding. For
  example, if you have a business site, make sure its URL is listed on your business cards,
  letterhead, posters, and other materials. With their permission, you could also send out recurring
  newsletters to your audience letting them know about new content on your website. As with everything in life, you can overdo promoting your site and actually harm it: people may get
  fatigued of your promotions, and search engines may perceive some of the practices as manipulation of search results . Things we believe you shouldn't focus on As SEO has evolved, so have the ideas and practices (and at times, misconceptions) related to it.
  What was considered best practice or top priority in the past may no longer be relevant or
  effective due to the way search engines (and the internet) have developed over time. To help you focus on the things that are actually important when it comes to SEO, we collected
  some of the most common and  prominent topics we've seen circulating the internet. In general, our
  message on these topics is that you should do what's best for your business area; we will
  elaborate on a few specific points here: Meta keywords Google Search doesn't use the keywords meta tag . Keyword stuffing Excessively repeating the same words over and over (even in
          variations) is tiring for users, and keyword stuffing is against Google's spam policies . Keywords in the domain name or URL path When picking the name of your site, do what's
            best for your business. Users will use this name to find you, so we recommend following general
            marketing best practices. From a ranking perspective, the keywords in the name of the domain (or
            URL path) alone have hardly any effect beyond appearing in breadcrumbs . And while still on the topic of domain names: the TLD (the domain name ending like "".com"" or
            "".guru"") only matters if you're targeting a specific country's users, and even then it's
            usually a low impact signal. For example, if you're trying to sell Dutch cheese to people
            searching from Switzerland, it makes some sense (both from business and SEO point of view )
            to use a .ch domain name. Otherwise Google Search doesn't care which TLD you're using (whether
            it's a .com or .org or .asia). Minimum or maximum content length The length of the content alone doesn't matter for
          ranking purposes (there's no magical word count target, minimum or maximum, though you
          probably want to have at least one word). If you are varying the words (writing naturally to
          not be repetitive), you have more chances to show up in Search simply because you are using
          more keywords. Subdomains versus subdirectories From a business point of view, do whatever makes sense
          for your business. For example, it might be easier to manage the site if it's segmented by
          subdirectories, but other times it might make sense to partition topics into subdomains,
          depending on your site's topic or industry. PageRank While PageRank uses links and is one of the fundamental algorithms at Google, there's much more to Google Search
          than just links. We have many ranking signals, and PageRank is just one of those. Duplicate content ""penalty"" If you have some content that's accessible under multiple
          URLs, it's fine; don't fret about it. It's inefficient, but it's not something that will cause
          a manual action. Copying others' content, however, is a different story. Number and order of headings Having your headings in semantic order is
            fantastic for screen readers, but from Google Search perspective, it doesn't matter if
            you're using them out of order. The web in general is not valid HTML, so Google Search can
            rarely depend on semantic meanings hidden in the HTML specification. There's also no magical, ideal amount of headings a given page should have. However, if you
            think it's too much, then it probably is. Thinking E-E-A-T is a ranking factor No, it's not. Next steps Get started with Search Console : Setting up a Search Console account helps you monitor

It's essentially a roadmap for all of your content marketing efforts and can be included in a more comprehensive marketing strategy . Typically, you'll want to design a content strategy that attracts and engages customers throughout all stages of the buyer's journey. In implementing a content strategy, you can expect to organize your existing content library, create new content, and monitor your content's success. What is a content strategist? Content strategists specifically work with content strategies to create branded content for their organizationâs channels, both print and digital. Their goal is to reach new customers and audience members, and they play an important role in a business as the content they write, edit, or publish helps a company reach its overarching goals.Â Common responsibilities for a content strategist are gathering information about their target audience, creating content strategy frameworks, maintaining SEO guidelines, managing and training a team of content collaborators, and more. Why is content strategy important? Every piece of content tells a story, and together, a body of content tells an even bigger story about who you are, your expertise, your values, and your place in the world. Developing a strategy for your content ensures that you're telling a cohesive narrative every time you hit publish. With an effective content strategy, you'll create opportunities to educate and serve your audience, establish yourself as an authority in your niche market , and show your audience why your business matters. How to create a content strategyÂ Review the following seven steps of the content strategy planning process: Define your goals. Research your target audience. Conduct a content audit. Choose your content types. Create your content plan. Develop a process for content creation.Â Measure the success of your content. Take a closer look at each step. 1. Define your content strategy goals. With clearly defined desired outcomes and success measures, you can design a strategy that moves you closer to your business goals. Think about what you'd like to achieve with your content. (At this stage, focus specifically on the ""what""âwe'll get to the ""how"" in later steps.) It may help to structure your goals with SMART methodology. SMART goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Below are some examples to draw from: Generate 50 percent more qualified leads in 90 days.Â Double the number of social media followers in 60 days.Â Get 100 new email subscribers in 30 days. 2. Research your target audience.Â Who are the potential customers you'd like to introduce to your business? This group of people makes up your target audience, and they likely have some shared characteristics worth keeping in mind as you develop your content. It may help to create a buyer persona, which is a fictional representation of your target customer that you use to guide your content creation process. Developing personas can make it easier to reflect on target customersâ needs and how your content can meet those needs.Â Some questions to ask as you develop your buyer persona include: What are their demographics and psychographics? What are their interests, values, and needs? How does your business fit into their lives? As you prepare your content strategy, it can also help to research how your target audience receives, consumes, and engages with content, as well as their preferred communication styles. 3. Conduct an audit of your current content marketing plan. Before you plan to create new content, it's worth revisiting the content you already have. Consider what types of content you've published, how well your content has performed, and whether your existing content has historically contributed to your company's goals. Additionally, consider the opposite: whether any of your content has underperformed or moved you away from your goals. Through assessing your current content library, you can gather hints about the types of content that your target audience might like or dislike in the future, and use this knowledge to guide future content plans. Conducting a competitor analysis In addition to auditing your own content, you may be able to learn more about your target audience through a competitor analysis . Evaluating the competitive landscape can help reveal industry standards and opportunities to create fresh content that fills gaps and better serves customers. During a competitor analysis, you'll examine the content practices of businesses targeting audiences who are similar to your target audience. Take note of the types of content they publish, where they publish, how their audience engages with their content, and the topics they cover. Then, consider what aspects of their content strategy you may want to adopt and how you can elevate your content beyond their offerings. 4. Choose your content strategy deliverables. Next, think about the types of content that you can reasonably create, your target audience is likely to react positively to, and that can help you reach your content goals. You may also consider different types of content for different stages of the customer journey. Some common types of content to consider include: Blog posts Social media posts Videos Podcasts Email newsletters Case studies White papers Templates E-books Once you choose the types of content that make the most sense for your needs, consider the steps you'll need to take to optimize your content types for the platform you plan to focus on. For example, if you're publishing blog posts on your company website, you may want to use search engine optimization (SEO) techniques and tools, which can help surface your content on search engines like Google for relevant search terms. Or, if you plan to incorporate social media content creation into your content strategy, you may want to consider the hashtags your target audience may follow or the viral moments they're responding to. Knowing how you'll optimize your content types for your chosen platforms is one way to think strategically about your content. 5. Create a content marketing strategy At this point, you have a strong foundation on which to start strategically planning your actual content. Reflect on the work you've done so far to determine the content topics you'd like to address across your various content types. Here, consider topics at the intersection of your unique expertise and your target audience's interests, values, or needs. You may also brainstorm ways you can further conversations around content areas that have historically performed well for you or that perform well for your direct business competitors. Leveraging your content across different platforms is another way to strategically approach your content. Audiences may have different communication expectations across different platforms. Think about how you can repurpose content pertaining to the same topic across your chosen platforms. Some people find it helpful to organize their content plan with a content calendar or an editorial calendar. 6. Learn how to make content and establish a process. With your pevelolan in place, youâll have more clarity around what you'll need to do in order to begin generating your content. Consider the people you'll need on your content team in order to meet your goals and execute your plan, whether that's content strategists tasked with audience research and ideation, content creators willing to appear on camera, or writers who can serve as subject matter experts. Also, consider the tools you might need as you develop and publish your content. Tools may include a content management system (CMS), social listening tools, or editing software. Since you'll need to generate content on a regular basis, a streamlined creation process can make it easier over time to come up with new ideas and build continuous content that serves your audience and expands your goals. 7. Measure the success of your content marketing strategy. Once your content is published and your audience begins engaging with it, youâll need to have a plan in place for measuring how well the content performs. Many websites, social media platforms, and email systems report metrics like the number of views or clicks a piece of content gets and how many people are subscribing or following over a span of time. Determine the metrics that are most relevant to your content goals, then decide on the best way to track those metrics over time. Once you begin to see how your content is performing, this will provide you with a basis for adjusting individual pieces of content or the strategy as a whole.Â Learn content strategy with Coursera Continue exploring how a strong content strategy can elevate your business practices.

Weâll build a plan together and help you get started. Book a demo In today's digital world, companies of all sizes and sectors have an online presence. That makes the competition for shoppers' attention fierce. Out of the 2.1 million ecommerce businesses in the US,  only a fraction of them will be able to attract enough customers and grow online sales. As an ecommerce merchant, you've probably figured out that digital marketing is critical for the long-term success of your online store. But what exactly is digital marketing, and how do you do it? Let's find out. What Is Digital Marketing? In pre-Internet days, businesses could promote themselves through billboards, television spots, direct mail, or store window displays. But with commerce and consumers (and, let's face it, most of our attention) moving to the online world, marketing and advertising have moved online, too. Marketers can now reach their target audience via digital channels such as social media, search engines, websites, text messages, and email, and these comprise what we think of as digital marketing or online marketing. Why You Need Digital Marketing Though the traditional channels are still in play, the digital marketing world offers several advantages. With online marketing you can reach global audiences.Â Personalization allows you to target and segment more effectively. Efficiency and automation let you do more with less marketing budget, even with a small marketing team. Your brand can attain greater visibility across digital channels. Software makes adopting digital marketing strategies faster and easier. You can communicate with customers more rapidly and frequently. Data collection and analysis enables your business to make better decisions. Types of Digital Marketing To capitalize on opportunities and stand out from your competition in this digital landscape, you need a successful digital marketing strategy . That means embracing a range of digital marketing activities. For example, software review site G2 has found that marketers using three or more channels in their campaigns see a purchase and engagement that's rate 250% higher than marketers using single channels. (1) Your digital marketing strategy might include popular inbound marketing tactics like social media, paid advertising, email marketing, influencer marketing, content marketing, SEO strategy, Google Adwords, affiliate marketing, and conversion rate optimization . And if your digital strategy doesn't yet include text marketing, it should. That's because text marketing consistently yields higher conversion rates than email and paid ads. G2 says text marketing âcontinues to be a best-kept secret ... 61% of marketers still donât use it.â (2) 11 Top Digital Marketing Tips Emotive helps ecommerce businesses harness the power of texting as a key component of a successful digital marketing strategy. But we know there's more to it than just texting, so we're sharing our best digital marketing tips with you. 1. Understand Your Customer Understanding your target audience is an essential step in ecommerce marketing. Who are they? What are their interests, needs, and desires? Where do they spend their time? To identify and understand your customers, you may want to conduct market research: this can be as simple as surveying some of your existing customers. You'll use this data to develop various buyer personas and a customer journey, which maps the steps a prospective customer takes on the path from anonymous shopper to loyal purchaser. You'll want to define customer segments, based on factors like age, gender, occupation, income, location, and interests. With a clear picture of your target customer, you can begin to create targeted marketing campaigns that speak to their interests. And don't forget customer feedback: this is a great source of data you can use to improve your offerings and your brand's customer experience. 2. Create Compelling Content One of the most important aspects of digital marketing is creating compelling and relevant content that draws people to visit your website. Clickbait content might get shoppers' attention, but if it doesn't provide value to your target audience, they'll likely leave before making a purchase. Valuable content can be in the form of blog posts, videos, infographics, or social media posts. Following are some marketing tips for effective content creation: Post content regularly. Create content that's entertaining, informative, and empathetic.Â Ensure your content is original and reflects your brand values. Make use of infographics and video.Â Customize content for different digital platforms. Consider asking customers to create user-generated content, featuring your products. Don't skimp on photography or design: aesthetics matter. Don't just promote your products: your content should speak to customers' needs and desires. Maintain consistent branding so shoppers can more easily identify you. 3. Regularly Optimize Your Website for SEO and ConversionsÂ Your website is the gateway to revenue, so it's important to optimize it for conversions. This means making sure it's easy to navigate, has a clear call-to-action, loads quickly, and offers frictionless checkout. Optimizing your website for conversions can yield a significant increase in online sales. Your site can also help you collect valuable customer data, such as top purchases, browsing history, click pathways, and more. By analyzing this data and identifying patterns, you'll discover opportunities for future optimizations and can target and segment customers more effectively.Â Your website and published content should also include top search keywords: the words and phrases that customers type into search engines when looking for products, services, and websites like yours. Google, most ecommerce platform providers, website builders, and other companies offer free tools that can help you research keywords and optimize your content accordingly. 4. Build a Presence on Social Media Platforms Most of your current and prospective customers spend a large part of their days scrolling their social media accounts, or hanging out in online communities at Reddit and Discord. Here are some social media marketing tips to help you take advantage of these ubiquitous platforms. Identify the platforms and communities where your customers spend time. Monitor what kinds of things they share about your business and industry, and their feelings about it.Â Publish content that entertains, educates, or informs your target audience: not just about your brand and products, but about your audience's needs and desires.Â Engage with your followers regularly by listening and responding to them on the social media platform or online community where they hang out.Â Employ high-quality images and video, as these are the most popular content forms.Â 5. Create Mobile-friendly Content Did you know that the Top 1000 North American-based online retailers receive 65% of their traffic from mobile devices? (3) If your website isn't optimized for mobile, you're likely losing new customers (and maybe even some loyal ones as well.) Make sure that your website looks good, loads quickly, and is easy-to-use on all devices. Optimize your site so that it's responsive on all digital devices like mobiles, tablets, and laptops. Measure your page speed as this is a critical factor to hook customers to your website. If the web pages load at a slow speed, chances are that your customers would leave the website. When framing mobile-friendly content: Keep your content short and straightforward. Use infographics and video content.Â Create a presence on social media as mobile users spend most of their screen time on social media platforms. 6. Integrate Marketing Across Multiple Platforms A key component of digital marketing is integrating your messaging, branding, and campaigns across many different platforms at once. Managing content across digital channels can be a challenging task but it's a critical to succeed online. Here are some digital marketing tips for integrating across platforms: Develop long-term digital marketing strategies that map to your mission and goals Use a CRM tool to track customer data and better understand audience behavior Run A/B tests and pay attention to conversion metrics like open rate, CTR, etc. Create a content calendar and socialize it across your organization Maintain consistent branding (fonts, colors, writing style) across channels Â 7. Get on Google My Business Google my Business is a free platform that allows businesses to create a listing on Google. It's free to use and a great way to reach potential customers, especially if you're a local business with customers who live near you. Make sure to claim your business listing and fill out all the information correctly. Other advantages of Google My Business: You can add or update relevant information about your business, such as contact details, website URL, images, videos, events, business hours, and more Customers can rate your business and add a review, which means you can respond to feedback and learn what your audience likes or dislikesÂ Adding your shop to Google My Business is a form of search engine optimization that enhances your search rankings You'll get timely reports with data on your business listing, such as the number of page views, notifications about user reviews, and more 8. Use Email and SMS/Text Marketing Efficiently There's a reason email is still the foundation of most digital marketing efforts: it's a high-volume, low-cost way to stay in touch with customers, remind them about your business, and promote your products, sales, and news. A plethora of software products make it easy to build email templates, track open rates and clicks, and keep your email list compliant and up-to-date. And adding a form, banner, or pop-up on your site to collect email addresses is an easy way to grow your potential customer base. Email is an ideal channel for communicating important information and timely information, but for urgent messages, look to SMS. SMS marketing â especially when it's two-way and conversational â helps you build relationships, create a sense of urgency, and meet shoppers where they spend a majority of their time: on their phones. Though a majority of marketers rely on email marketing, research firm Gartner has found that text marketing campaigns have response rates are 7X higher and click-through-rates more than 30 times higher than email. (4) Texts are an ideal channel for high-conversion marketing messages, such as abandoned cart reminders, Black Friday sales and other promotional content, and personalized or segmented messages based on user data.Â 9. Invest in Digital Advertising Pay-per-click advertising is one of the most effective digital marketing strategies for reaching your target audience and driving traffic to your site. It can feel risky to spend money on digital ads, but in the highly competitive ecommerce marketplace, PPC ads are table stakes. PPC ads can be a useful tool for experimenting with your message and brand, with the end goal being that you learn what gets the most clicks and can constantly improve your ROI. Google Ads and YouTube Ads are examples of PPC advertising, as are social media platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. 10. Personalize Content Every day we share key pieces of information about ourselves online. As an ecommerce business, you can harness this data in respectful and legal ways to better understand your shoppers and connect them with the products they need and desire. This kind of personalization â whether it's addressing emails to customers by their first name, or notifying customers that an item they browsed at your website is back in stock â is a key competitive advantage in digital marketing. Research from Demand Metric finds that 82% of customers feel more positive about a brand after engaging with personalized content. (5 ) By personalizing your content to shoppers' needs and interests, you'll be able to improve your conversions and see a higher return on investment for your efforts. 11. Make Use of Modern Digital Tools Just as online stores are an evolution from brick-and-mortar stores. digital marketing tools make marketers more efficient, data-driven, and effective online. They can also help you improve your site's customer experience and customer journey, from lead to referral. Here are some examples to explore if you're not already doing so. Chatbots use artificial intelligence to communicate with visitors. They can be used to answer questions, provide customer support, and promote products. Chatbots are a scalable and affordable way to connect with customers on a personal level when you can't have a real human available to answer every question. Video is a growing medium for connecting with consumers: the amount of video people watch online has doubled since 2018, and 87% of marketers who use video say it has positive ROI. (6) Try video prospecting: using short, personal videos to introduce your business and brand, explain your products, and build relationships with potential customers. Or add product demos to your site to help educate customers and speed up the sales process. Make sure you're using all the integrations available on the ecommerce platform you're using. These integrations are designed to make your business more efficient and free you up to focus on other things, primarily by connecting your data across software platforms and giving you a more accurate view of your business.

Why Digital Marketing Is Important Types and Strategies of Digital Marketing Benefits of Digital Marketing Digital Marketing Best Practices Bottom Line Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Show more Digital marketing is one of the most popular and powerful ways to generate awareness, interest and sales for your products or services. As the name implies, digital marketing is conducted via digital avenues, including social media, websites, search engines, email and text messaging. For optimal results, you must understand which digital marketing tactics will work best for your target audience. This post offers an in-depth look at the most effective digital marketing strategies and best practices for achieving your business goals. What Is Digital Marketing? Also known as online marketing or internet marketing , digital marketing communicates messages through digital channels accessed through electronic devices, including phones, computers and tablets. Digital marketing and traditional marketing, such as print ads and direct mail, share the same ultimate goal: generating product awareness and influencing purchasing decisions to drive sales. The main difference between traditional and digital marketing is that digital marketing uses internet-connected technologies to communicate and engage with targeted audiences. The launch of the World Wide Web in 1989 set the stage for the emergence of digital marketing. The proliferation of business websites, advancements in email technologies and the introduction of wildly popular social channels have sparked meteoric growth in digital marketing. Online marketing is now a key component in most businesses’ marketing plans primarily because of the widespread use of digital technologies but also because it can deliver outstanding results. Why Digital Marketing Is Important To succeed, businesses must find effective ways to spread the word about their products and services and that’s never been more challenging than today. Consumers face more choices from more providers, all clamoring for their attention. Deploying compelling content on digital marketing platforms is one way to stand out from the crowd. Another reason digital marketing is so important to businesses is simply this: it’s where your ideal customer is hanging out. According to the research experts at Statista, as of 2023, there are 5.19 billion internet users and 4.88 billion social media users worldwide. On average, internet users spend six hours and 40 minutes online every day. This enormous, highly engaged online audience presents tremendous opportunities for businesses that want to gain visibility for their goods and services. Digital marketing offers near-endless opportunities for connecting with potential customers and is a vital component of nearly every business’s marketing mix . Types and Strategies of Digital Marketing Creating a solid digital marketing strategy for your business begins with a better understanding of the types of digital marketing methods that yield the best returns. Below, we introduce you to six types of digital marketing: social media marketing, search engine marketing (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, email marketing, mobile marketing and content marketing. Social Media Marketing Social media marketing is one of the most popular forms of digital marketing. In the United States alone, over 308 million people access a social network at least once per month. People of all ages use social media for entertainment, interacting with others, gaining information about specific interests and shopping. For businesses hoping to gain visibility and sales, social media statistics reveal that incorporating social media into your marketing mix can be a sound strategy. Social media is the go-to source for brand information for 78% of internet users. Nearly half of U.S. consumers report they’ve made a purchase through social media. Top social platforms include YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Snapchat and X (formerly Twitter). New platforms, such as BeReal and Poparazzi, are entering the market regularly. The social landscape is ever-evolving. For example, Twitter, now X, was once a top platform, but the social channel now appears to be struggling. Twitter has lost approximately 32 million users since Elon Musk purchased the platform in 2022. TikTok didn’t even come on the international scene until 2017, but now has more than 1.7 billion monthly active users . Digital marketers need to remain attentive to social media channel changes. SEO Search engine optimization (SEO) is a vital digital marketing strategy for businesses that benefit from driving traffic to their websites. SEO is the process of optimizing your website so search engines, such as Google rank your website high on search engine results pages (SERPs). SEO is all about driving organic traffic to your site. Unlike paid advertising, with SEO, visitors who find your site come from unpaid searches. Approximately 8.5 billion searches are done on Google daily, which presents a lot of opportunities for businesses that want to promote their product and services. Ranking high on Google is key to driving more traffic to your website. In a survey conducted by Search Engine Journal , 49% of respondents reported that SEO delivers the highest return on investment (ROI) of any digital marketing channel. You can get started with SEO on your own for free by learning more about Google Ranking Factors or with the help of top SEO tools and software . You can also work with an SEO service or agency to create an SEO plan and manage your SEO for you. PPC Advertising PPC advertising is precisely what the name implies: you pay a fee every time someone clicks on your digital ads. The amount you’ll pay is determined by the platform you’re advertising on, the potential traffic for your promoted post and the number of competitors willing to pay for similar ads. Google Ads is the largest PPC platform in the world. Many businesses who engage in SEO marketing also engage in PPC advertising on Google. Paid ads on Google appear above organic search results and that positioning advantage can drive even more traffic to your website. Google Ads is not your only avenue for PPC advertising. You can also purchase PPC ads via the Microsoft Search Network on Bing and partner sites as well as on top social channels, including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Amazon and TikTok. Email Marketing Email marketing is another top digital marketing strategy you’ll likely want to add to your marketing mix. According to Statista, businesses earn an average of at least $32 for every dollar spent on email marketing. For some sectors, such as retail, e-commerce and consumer goods, that number is $45. To be effective at email marketing, you must develop a strategy for collecting email addresses from clients and prospects. Many businesses collect emails with every customer encounter, sometimes offering a special incentive for joining an email list. Your business website is also a terrific place to offer incentives to visitors so you can grow your email database. Growing and nurturing your email list is vital to successful email marketing . You also must respect the communication preferences of your list and only send relevant information that your base wants to receive. Also, failing to manage the legal aspects of email marketing, including staying compliant with CAN/SPAM Act mandates, is paramount for email marketing success. Rather than managing business email manually, most marketers acquire email marketing software. The best email marketing software makes it effortless to keep your email database updated, handling new subscribers and unsubscribes for you. Your email software should also make it easy to segment your email database based on customer interests, create attractive email designs, manage email scheduling and measure email metrics, including open rates, click-through rates (CTR), conversion rates and bounce rates. Check out our list of email marketing examples to get a better idea of the topic. Mobile Marketing There are more than 310 million smartphone users in the U.S. alone, so it should be no surprise that mobile marketing has become a popular digital marketing strategy for businesses. Mobile marketing typically is conducted via text, also called short message service (SMS). Text open rates are estimated to be as high as 98%, which is one reason mobile marketing can be so effective. While text messaging is the most common way to market via mobile devices, notifications from mobile apps and social channels can also be received on smartphones. The business applications for mobile marketing are expanding every day. Content Marketing Every form of digital marketing relies on compelling content to attract interest and engage prospects and customers. Content marketing is the term used to describe the different types of content you can develop to deploy in your digital marketing campaigns. Content marketing can take many forms, including blogs, infographics, whitepapers, ebooks, videos, podcasts, quizzes, slide decks and webinars. Unlike advertising, content marketing is not blatantly promotional but instead employs more subtle tactics to inform, educate or influence a desired target market. You can use content marketing to establish authority on particular subjects or create buzz for your brand. One of the key advantages of content marketing is that you can do it on virtually any budget. A do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to content marketing will cost you mere pennies or, if your budget allows, you can work with copywriters, videographers, designers and other content development experts to create content for your business.

Here are the top benefits: Budget-friendly: You can engage in some forms of digital marketing, such as email and social media, with little to no money. Measurable results: Most forms of digital marketing allow you to measure key performance metrics, including total number of impressions, CTRs, cost per conversion, overall conversion rates and more. Improved brand awareness: With so many people using digital devices to access social channels, texts and emails, you have near-unlimited potential to generate awareness for your brand and products. Strong engagement: Digital marketing lets you create compelling content via text, images and video, leading to strong customer engagement. Strong ROI potential: Digital marketing often earns a more substantial ROI than traditional marketing and advertising tactics. Global and regional reach: Depending on the digital marketing tactics you choose, you can limit your reach to a local or regional area or use digital channels, such as YouTube and TikTok, where your content can reach a global audience. Flexibility: You can change or adopt new digital marketing strategies relatively quickly. Digital Marketing Best Practices While digital marketing can be very effective for building business results, you must understand the drivers of success. When you embrace direct marketing best practices, you’re far more likely to achieve the stellar results you want. Establish Your Digital Marketing Goals Before engaging in any type of digital marketing, you must establish SMART goals . Specifically, what do you want to accomplish? Examples of top digital marketing goals include: Increase website traffic Build brand awareness Boost brand engagement Become known as an expert in your industry Generate more qualified leads Expand your email prospect database Increase sales Define Your Target Audience You must have a well-defined audience in mind before selecting digital marketing channels and content marketing strategies. Otherwise, you risk creating messaging or using digital marketing tactics that are off the mark. Defining your target audience begins with identifying shared attributes, including age, gender, income and education levels, geographic locations, interests and purchasing patterns. Next, you need to identify the specific problems your audience is facing or the pressing desires they have. Once your target audience is defined clearly, you can develop digital marketing messaging that highlights how your business solves their top problems or satisfies their needs. Determine Your Digital Marketing Budget Establishing a digital marketing budget will keep you from under or overspending. Setting clear marketing goals and success targets will ensure your digital marketing spend is on target. You may choose to establish a budget for each digital channel or an overall budget for all efforts. It’s important to have a good handle on digital marketing costs to set a strong budget. Be sure to consider the technologies you’ll need to deploy your digital marketing efforts, including SEO software, email marketing software, website hosting services and social media management tools. If you plan to do PPC advertising, you must research costs related to the platforms you intend to use. PPC costs are platform-specific and Google Ads and most social media channels offer extensive information about PPC costs on their advertising portals. Other costs you may need to incorporate into your digital marketing budget include marketing services for copywriting, videography and design. If your budget allows, you can work with a traditional marketing agency, which can cost anywhere from $75 to $300 per hour. If you’re on a shoestring budget, you may want to hire freelancers from popular gig sites, such as Upwork, Fiverr and Freelancer.com, which can cost as little as $15 per hour. Select Your Digital Marketing Methods Launching a company website is the first step in digital marketing for many businesses. The additional digital marketing methods you choose depend on what you’re selling, where your ideal audience is spending their time and how much money you want to spend on digital marketing. Social media, SEO and email are the most popular digital marketing techniques, but you may find a different mix works best for your target market. Track and Analyze Results The beauty of digital marketing is that it’s relatively easy to track results. In setting your goals, you establish what you’re hoping to achieve. In the analysis stage of digital marketing, you measure how well you’re performing against established goals. Set a cadence for how often you’ll monitor digital marketing performance data: daily (which is only advised in initial stages or when digital marketing spending is high), weekly or monthly. Very few digital efforts achieve stellar results out of the gate, so don’t be disheartened if you aren’t hitting stretch goals on the first iteration of your marketing efforts. Learn from your analyses to refine your digital marketing strategies accordingly going forward. Bottom Line Digital marketing is one of the most powerful tools businesses have to generate attention and sales for their products and services. Several digital marketing techniques, including social media marketing, email marketing, SEO, PPC advertising and content marketing, offer exceptional ROI potential. You don’t need a large budget to get started, so digital marketing can be an effective tool for all types of businesses. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is digital marketing in simple words?

Digital marketing, also called online marketing, refers to all marketing efforts that occur on the internet. Businesses leverage digital channels such as search engines, social media, email, and other websites to connect with current and prospective customers. This also includes communication through text or multimedia messages. How does a business define digital marketing? Digital marketing is vital for your business and brand awareness. It seems like every other brand has a website, and if they don't, they at least have a social media presence or digital ad strategy. Overall, digital marketing is defined as using numerous digital tactics and channels to connect with customers where they spend much of their time: online.

Download Now The best digital marketers have a clear picture of how each digital marketing campaign supports their overarching goals. Depending on the goals of their marketing strategy, marketers can support a larger campaign through the free and paid channels they have available. A content marketer, for example, could create a series of blog posts that generate leads from an ebook. A social media marketer might help promote those blogs through paid and organic posts on the business's social media accounts , and the email marketer could create an email campaign to send those who download the ebook more information on the company. Our 2025 State of Marketing Report found that the top five marketing channels that resulted in the biggest ROI in 2024 involved digital marketing. They are: Email marketing. Paid social media content. Social media shopping tools (e.g., Instagram shops). Website/blog/SEO. Content marketing. Why is digital marketing important? Digital marketing helps you reach a larger audience than you could through traditional methods and target the prospects who are most likely to buy your product or service. Additionally, it's often more cost-effective than traditional advertising and enables you to measure success on a daily basis and pivot as you see fit. There are a few major benefits of digital marketing: 1. You can focus your efforts on only the prospects most likely to purchase your product or service. Digital marketing allows you to identify and target a highly specific audience with personalized and high-converting marketing messages. For instance, you might use social media targeting to show ads to a certain audience based on variables like age, gender, location, interests, networks, or behaviors. Alternatively, you might use PPC or SEO strategies to serve ads to users who've shown interest in or searched for specific keywords related to your product, service, or industry. Ultimately, digital marketing helps you conduct the research necessary to identify your buyer personas and refine your strategy to ensure you’re reaching prospects most likely to buy. 2. It's more cost-effective than outbound marketing methods. Digital marketing helps you track campaign performance day to day, so you know which channels are performing well and which aren’t. This information helps you optimize your campaign budgets for high ROI. A digital marketing strategy allows you to pivot continuously, ensuring you never waste money on channels that don't perform well. For instance, if you work for a small business with a limited budget , you might try investing in social media, blogging, or SEO — three strategies that can give you high ROI even with minimal spending. 3. Online marketing evens the playing field within your industry and allows you to compete with bigger brands. If you work for a small business, it's likely difficult for you to compete with the major brands in your industry, many of which have millions of dollars to invest in campaigns. Fortunately, there are plenty of opportunities to outrank the big players through strategic digital marketing initiatives. For instance, you might use long-tail keywords to create high-quality content that ranks on search engines. Search engines don’t care which brand is the biggest, but they do care about prioritizing content that resonates best with target audiences. Adilo, an online video hosting platform competing against established brands in the space, understood the potential of focusing on search. “We knew that trying to compete head-on with paid strategies like TV commercials, PPC, and print media would be a disaster, so we went all-in on content marketing … We also invested heavily in creating original and linkable articles to gain exposure and earned media,” says Felix Johnson , Senior SEO and Content Strategist at Adilo . Today, Johnson notes that over 95% of new signups come from Google Search. 4. Digital marketing is measurable. One of the biggest benefits of digital marketing is that it gives a start-to-finish view of all the metrics that matter to your company — including impressions, shares, views, clicks, and time on the page. Unlike most offline marketing efforts, digital marketing allows marketers to see accurate results in real time. If you‘ve ever put an advertisement in a newspaper, you’ll know how difficult it is to estimate how many people flipped to that page and paid attention to it. There's no surefire way to know if that ad was responsible for any sales at all. On the other hand, with digital marketing, you can measure the ROI of pretty much any aspect of your marketing efforts. Here are some examples: Website Traffic With digital marketing, you can see the exact number of people who have viewed your website's homepage in real time by using digital analytics software available in marketing platforms like HubSpot. You can also see how many pages they visited, what device they were using, and where they came from, amongst other digital analytics data. This intelligence helps you prioritize which marketing channels to spend more or less time on based on the number of people those channels drive to your website. With digital marketing, you can identify trends and patterns in people‘s behavior before they’ve reached the final stage in their buyer's journey, meaning you can make more informed decisions about how to attract them to your website right at the top of the marketing funnel. HubSpot Marketing Analytics Software Measure the performance of all your marketing campaigns in one place with built-in analytics, reports, and dashboards. Marketing Analytics Dashboard Software Website KPIs And More! Get started free Content Performance and Lead Generation Imagine you‘ve created a product brochure and posted it through people’s letterboxes — that brochure is a form of offline content. Unfortunately, you have no idea how many people opened your brochure or threw it straight into the trash. If you have that brochure on your website, you can measure how many people viewed the page it’s on, and you can use a form to collect the contact information of those who downloaded it. It’s twofold: you measure how many people engage with your content and generate qualified leads when people download it. Attribution Modeling An effective digital marketing strategy combined with the right tools and technologies allows you to trace all of your sales back to a customer's first digital touchpoint with your business. We call this attribution modeling. It allows you to identify trends in the way people research and buy your product, helping you to make more informed decisions about which parts of your marketing strategy deserve more attention and which parts of your sales cycle need refining. 5. It’s easier to adapt and change an online marketing strategy. A great benefit of digital marketing is the ease with which you can change your strategy. Adapting a digital marketing strategy is much easier than other, more traditional forms of marketing, like mailers or billboard advertising. For instance, if an online ad isn’t delivering as expected, you can quickly adjust it or pause it to yield better results. 6. Online marketing can improve your conversion rate and the quality of your leads. As digital marketing makes it simpler to measure your marketing efforts, improving your conversion rate becomes simpler as well. Being able to measure the effectiveness of each tactic helps you develop better strategies. Continuously refining your methods improves your conversion rate. Investing in online marketing ensures that everything is optimized for the highest amount of conversions. Additionally, not all leads offer the same value for your business. Digital marketing allows you to target a specific audience, which will yield higher-quality leads that are more likely to become customers. Connecting your business with the most valuable leads will directly improve your conversion rate. 7. You can engage audiences at every stage with digital marketing. Engaging your audience as early as possible is essential. Making a connection at the first stage of the buyer’s journey helps push the lead through the customer funnel. Using digital marketing allows you to accomplish that from start to finish and at every point in between. Online channels allow you to follow your customers' entire buying journey. Understanding and analyzing how customers operate is important for converting leads. Digital marketing allows you to track them through that process. And, even if they don’t convert in the early stages, it at least helps ensure they have made a connection with your business. Another way to connect with your customers is to ensure brand content resonates with customer values. Our survey revealed that 37.52% of marketers feel that one of the biggest ways the marketing industry changed in the past twelve months is focusing on the customer, and their experience with the brand became more important. Additionally, one in five (21.19%) said that one of the top marketing trends they or their teammates are currently exploring is creating content that reflects brand values. Richard White , content team lead at Omnisend , an ecommerce email marketing and SMS platform, says, “We’re absolutely aligning our content with our brand values because we believe that it’s the only way to make digital marketing work long-term.” White says his team sticks stick to topics that actively help customers grow their businesses. Then, then listen for to see the response. “Direct feedback, support conversations, social media — we track all of it to ensure we stay relevant and valuable to our customers,” White says.

Download Now Types of Digital Marketing Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Content Marketing Social Media Marketing Pay Per Click (PPC) Affiliate Marketing Native Advertising Marketing Automation Email Marketing Online PR Inbound Marketing Sponsored Content Influencer Marketing Search Engine Marketing (SEM) Instant Messaging Marketing Here's a quick rundown of some of the most common digital marketing tactics and the channels involved in each one. 1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) This is the process of optimizing your website to “rank” higher in search engine results pages, thereby increasing the amount of organic (or free) traffic your website receives. The channels that benefit from SEO include websites, blogs, and infographics. There are a number of ways to approach SEO in order to generate qualified traffic to your website. These include the following. On-Page SEO This type of SEO focuses on all of the content that exists “on the page” when looking at a website. By researching keywords for their search volume and intent (or meaning), you can answer questions for readers and rank higher on the search engine results pages (SERPs) those questions produce. Off-Page SEO This type of SEO focuses on all of the activity that takes place “off the page” when looking to optimize your website. “What activity not on my own website could affect my ranking?” You might ask. The answer is inbound links, also known as backlinks. The number of publishers that link to you, and the relative “authority” of those publishers, affects how highly you rank for the keywords you care about. By networking with other publishers, writing guest posts on these websites, and generating external attention, you can earn the backlinks you need to move your website up on all the right SERPs. Technical SEO This type of SEO focuses on the backend of your website, and how your pages are coded. Image compression, structured data, and CSS file optimization are all forms of technical SEO that can increase your website's loading speed — an important ranking factor in the eyes of search engines like Google. For a real-life example on how to successfully implement SEO into your digital marketing strategy, check out our case study on Canva here: 2. Content Marketing This term denotes the creation and promotion of content assets for the purpose of generating brand awareness, traffic growth, lead generation, and customers. Want to learn and apply content marketing to your business? Check out HubSpot Academy's free content marketing training resource page . The channels that can play a part in your content marketing strategy include: Blog posts. Publishing articles on a company blog helps you demonstrate your industry expertise and generates organic search traffic for your business. This ultimately gives you more opportunities to convert website visitors into leads for your sales team. Ebooks and whitepapers. Ebooks, whitepapers, and similar long-form content helps further educate website visitors. It also allows you to exchange content for a reader‘s contact information, generating leads for your company and moving people through the buyer’s journey. Infographics. Sometimes, readers want you to show, not tell. Infographics are a form of visual content that helps website visitors visualize a concept you want to help them learn. Audio or visual content. Television and radio are popular channels for digital marketing. Creating content that can be shared online as a video or heard on the radio by listeners can greatly broaden your potential audience.

If you're new to social platforms, you can use tools like HubSpot to connect channels like LinkedIn and Facebook in one place. This way, you can easily schedule content for multiple channels at once and monitor analytics from the platform as well. On top of connecting social accounts for posting purposes, you can also integrate your social media inboxes into HubSpot, so you can get your direct messages in one place. The channels you can use in social media marketing include: Facebook X LinkedIn Instagram Snapchat Pinterest According to marketers , the social media channels that resulted in the biggest ROI in 2024 are Facebook followed by Instagram. Another benefit of social media is the ability of a marketing campaign to go viral. Partnering with a popular content creator or participating in a trend that resonates with a wide audience is a viral marketing strategy. The purpose is to create something share-worthy in the hopes that it will organically spread across a social media channel. Don't know how to get started with social media marketing?

Pay Per Click (PPC) PPC drives traffic to your website by paying a publisher every time your ad is clicked. One of the most common types of PPC is Google Ads, which allows you to pay for top slots on Google's search engine results pages at a price “per click” of the links you place. Other channels where you can use PPC include: Paid ads on Facebook : Here, users can pay to customize a video, image post, or slideshow, which Facebook will publish to the news feeds of people who match your business's audience. X Ads campaigns: Here, users can pay to place a series of posts or profile badges on the news feeds of a specific audience, all dedicated to accomplishing a specific goal for your business. This goal can be website traffic, more X followers, tweet engagement, or even app downloads. Sponsored Messages on LinkedIn: Here, users can pay to send messages directly to specific LinkedIn users based on their industry and background. PPC can be hard to grasp at first, so we've created a beginner-friendly guide to get you started. Download it below: Download This Guide 5. Affiliate Marketing This is a type of performance-based advertising where you receive a commission for promoting someone else's products or services on your website. Affiliate marketing channels include: Hosting video ads through the YouTube Partner Program . Posting affiliate links from your social media accounts. Including affiliate links on your blog or website. 6. Native Advertising Native advertising refers to advertisements that are primarily content-led and featured on a platform alongside other, non-paid content. BuzzFeed-sponsored posts are a good example, but many people also consider social media advertising to be “native” — Facebook advertising and Instagram advertising, for example. 7. Marketing Automation Marketing automation refers to the software that automates your basic marketing operations. Many marketing departments can automate repetitive tasks they would otherwise do manually, such as: Email newsletters. Email automation doesn't just allow you to automatically send emails to your subscribers. It can also help you shrink and expand your contact list as needed, so your newsletters are only going to the people who want to see them in their inboxes. Social media post scheduling. If you want to grow your organization's presence on a social network, you need to post frequently. This makes manual posting a bit of an unruly process. Social media scheduling tools push your content to your social media channels so you can spend more time focusing on content strategy. Lead-nurturing workflows. Generating leads, and converting those leads into customers, can be a long process.You can automate that process by sending leads specific emails and content once they fit certain criteria, such as when they download and open an ebook. Campaign tracking and reporting. Marketing campaigns can include a ton of different people, emails, content, web pages, phone calls, and more. Marketing automation can help you sort everything you work on by the campaign it's serving and then track the performance of that campaign based on the progress all of these components make over time. 8. Email Marketing Companies use email marketing as a way of communicating with their audiences. Email is often used to promote content, discounts and events, as well as to direct people toward the business's website. The types of emails you might send in an email marketing campaign include: Blog subscription newsletters. Follow-up emails to website visitors who downloaded something. Customer welcome emails. Holiday promotions to loyalty program members. Tips or similar series emails for customer nurturing. Learn more about email marketing with our free guide: Download This Guide 9. Online PR Online PR is the practice of securing earned online coverage with digital publications, blogs, and other content-based websites. It's much like traditional PR but in the online space. The channels you can use to maximize your PR efforts include: Reporter outreach via social media. Talking to journalists on X, for example, is a great way to develop a relationship with the press that produces earned media opportunities for your company. Engaging online reviews of your company. When someone reviews your company online, whether that review is good or bad, your instinct might be not to touch it. On the contrary, engaging company reviews helps you humanize your brand and deliver powerful messaging that protects your reputation. Engaging comments on your personal website or blog. Similar to how you'd respond to reviews of your company, responding to the people reading your content is the best way to generate productive conversation around your industry. If you don‘t have a dedicated PR team, it can be hard to get started. Luckily, we’ve got you covered. Download our free PR kit below: Download This Guide 10. Inbound Marketing Inbound marketing refers to a marketing methodology wherein you attract, engage, and delight customers at every stage of the buyer's journey. You can use every digital marketing tactic listed above throughout an inbound marketing strategy to create a customer experience that works with the customer, not against them. Here are some classic examples of inbound marketing versus traditional marketing: Blogging vs. pop-up ads. Video marketing vs. commercial advertising. Email contact lists vs. email spam. 11. Sponsored Content With sponsored content , you, as a brand, pay another company or entity to create and promote content that discusses your brand or service in some way. One popular type of sponsored content is influencer marketing. Another type could be a blog post or article highlighting a topic, service, or brand. 12. Influencer Marketing Influencer marketing falls under sponsored content, but with the exponential rise of content creators and influencers, I believe it deserves its own section. Here, a brand sponsors an influencer in its industry to publish posts or videos related to the company on social media. According to marketers , Instagram and Facebook are the top two platforms delivering the highest ROI from influencers. Another trend that appeared is the rise of the niche or small-scale influencer as a key channel. 44.88% of marketers say they saw the most success with micro influencers/content creators in 2024 i.e., those with 10,000-99,999 followers/subscribers. The biggest benefits of working with influencers with a following count under 100k compared to those with higher? More trust with followers, access to niche and tight-knit communities, and lower costs. Katerina Andreeva , head of talent relations at HypeFactory , a global influencer marketing agency, says, “While working with micro-influencers, we notice how perfectly imperfect and sincere the content they create is. They have the honesty that the modern audience is looking for among AI-generated content and deep fakes.” She adds that micro-influencers cover niche topics that speak directly to often-overlooked audiences. This makes creators attractive to a narrow audience, creating a community of like-minded people around the influencer. “Since the audience of micro-creators is engaged and loyal, the conversion rate of the brand's advertising message increases,” Andreeva says. Finding the right content creators can take your digital campaign to the next level. Download our free guide below: Download This Guide 13. Search Engine Marketing (SEM) When a potential lead is searching for a product or business related to yours, it’s a great opportunity for a promotion. Paid advertising and SEO are two great strategies for promoting your business and capitalizing on future leads. Search engine marketing is another way to increase website traffic by placing paid ads on search engines. The two most popular SEM services are Bing Ads and Google Ads . These paid ads fit seamlessly on the top of search engine results pages, giving instant visibility. This is also an example of effective native advertising . 14. Instant Messaging Marketing Marketing your products through messaging platforms is a fast way to reach potential leads, even for those who haven’t offered up their cell phone number. For example, you can send messages directly to a mobile phone via text or on platforms like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. It’s a simple way to let your audience know about flash sales, new products, or updates about their orders. If your customers have questions or need more information, it’s also a convenient way for them to connect to customer service. You should also consider implementing live chat on your website here. This way, first-time website visitors will have a quick and easy way to reach out in case they have any questions about your products or services, while you get to promptly offer the details necessary to solve the visitor’s query — details which may lead to an on-the-spot conversion. What does a digital marketer do? Digital marketers are in charge of driving brand awareness and lead generation through all the digital channels — both free and paid — that are at a company's disposal. These channels include social media, the company's own website, search engine rankings, email, display advertising, and the company's blog. The digital marketer focuses on each channel‘s key performance indicators (KPIs) to properly measure performance. For example, a digital marketer in charge of SEO might measure their website’s organic traffic. At small companies, one person might own many digital channels and tactics described above, while larger companies typically have a specialist focused on one or two brand channels. Here are some examples of these specialists: SEO Manager Main KPIs: Organic traffic SEO managers work to rank a business on Google SERPs. Using various SEO strategies, this person might work directly with content creators to ensure the content is high-quality and up to Google’s standards, even if the company also posts this content on social media. Content Marketing Specialist Main KPIs: Time on page, overall blog traffic, YouTube channel subscribers Content marketing specialists are digital content creators. They might keep track of a blogging calendar or develop a content strategy that includes video. They often work with people in other departments to ensure products and campaigns are supported by promotional content on all digital channels. Social Media Manager Main KPIs: Follows, Impressions, Shares A social media manager's role depends on each company and industry. Above all, social media managers manage social media by establishing a posting schedule for the company’s written and visual content. They might also work with a content marketing specialist to develop a strategy for which content to share on social media. (Note: Per the KPIs above, “impressions” refer to the number of times a business‘s posts appear on a user’s newsfeed.) Interesting stat: Social media roles are sought after in marketing recruitment. The top three marketing roles expected tobe top priorities to hire in 2025 are content creator, social media coordinator, and social media strategist. Marketing Automation Coordinator Main KPIs: Email open rate, campaign click-through rate, lead-generation (conversion) rate A marketing automation coordinator helps choose and manage the software a marketing team uses to understand customer behavior and measure business growth. Many of the marketing operations described above might be executed separately, so it’s important for there to be someone who can group these activities into individual campaigns and track performance. Inbound Marketing vs. Digital Marketing: Which Is It? Inbound marketing is a methodology that uses digital marketing assets to attract, engage, and delight customers online. Digital marketing, on the other hand, is simply an umbrella term to describe online marketing tactics of any kind, regardless of whether they're considered inbound or outbound. Digital marketing is often compared to inbound marketing , but it doesn’t differentiate between ‘inbound’ and ‘outbound’ methods. It’s more of an umbrella term for all marketing that involves digital communication, while inbound marketing is more of a strategy. Digital outbound tactics put a marketing message in front of as many people as possible online — regardless of whether it's relevant or welcomed. For example, the garish banner ads you see on websites that push a product or promotion to people who aren’t necessarily ready to receive it. Marketers who employ digital inbound tactics use online content to attract their target customers by providing assets that are helpful to them. One of the simplest yet most powerful inbound digital marketing assets is a blog, which allows your website to capitalize on the terms that your ideal customers are searching for.

Get free marketing software Does online marketing work for all businesses? Digital marketing can work for any business in any industry. Regardless of what your company sells, digital marketing still involves building buyer personas to identify your audience's needs, and creating valuable online content. However, that's not to say all businesses should implement a digital marketing strategy in the same way. B2B Digital Marketing If your company is business-to-business (B2B), your digital marketing efforts are likely centered around online lead generation , with the end goal being for someone to speak to a salesperson. The goal of your marketing strategy might be to attract and convert the highest quality leads for your salespeople via your website and to support digital channels. Beyond your website, you'll probably choose to focus your efforts on business-focused channels like LinkedIn, where your demographic is spending their time online. B2C Digital Marketing If your company is business-to-consumer (B2C), depending on the price point of your products, it's likely that the goal of your digital marketing efforts is to attract people to your website and have them become customers without ever needing to speak to a salesperson. You‘re probably less likely to focus on ‘leads’ in their traditional sense and more likely to build an accelerated buyer's journey from when someone lands on your website to when they make a purchase. This can mean that your product features are higher up in the marketing funnel than it might be for a B2B business, and you might need to use stronger calls-to-action to inspire purchases. For B2C companies, channels like Instagram and Pinterest are often more valuable than business-focused platforms like LinkedIn. What types of digital content should I create? The kind of content you create depends on your audience‘s needs at different stages in the buyer’s journey. You should start by creating buyer personas (use these free templates , or try makemypersona.com ) to identify what your audience's goals and challenges are in relation to your business. On a basic level, your online content should aim to help them meet these goals and overcome their challenges. Then, you‘ll need to consider when they’re most likely to be ready to consume this content in line with their stage in the buyer's journey. We call this content mapping. With content mapping, the goal is to target content according to: The characteristics of the person who will be consuming it (that's where buyer personas come in). How close that person is to making a purchase (i.e., their lifecycle stage). In terms of the format of your content, there are a lot of different things to try. Here are some options we‘d recommend using at each stage of the buyer’s journey: Awareness Stage Blog posts. Your blog is great for increasing your organic traffic when paired with a strong SEO and keyword strategy. (You can plug your search terms into our blog topic generator to get content ideas and generate readily optimized outlines.) Infographics. These images are very shareable, meaning they increase your chances of being found via social media when others share your content. (Check out these free infographic templates to get you started.) Short videos. Again, these are very shareable and can help your brand get found by new audiences by hosting them on platforms like Instagram, Tik Tok, and YouTube. Short-form video is also the top media format marketers plan to invest the most in 2025. Consideration Stage Ebooks. Great for lead generation as they're generally more comprehensive than a blog post or infographic, meaning someone is more likely to exchange their contact information to receive it. Research reports. Again, this high-value content type is great for lead generation. Research reports and new data for your industry can also work for the awareness stage, though, as they're often picked up by the media or industry press. Webinars. As they're a more detailed, interactive form of video content, webinars are an effective consideration stage content format as they offer more comprehensive content than a blog post or short video. Decision Stage Case studies. Having detailed case studies on your website can be an effective form of content for those ready to make a purchasing decision, as it helps you positively influence their decision. Testimonials. If case studies aren‘t a good fit for your business, having short testimonials around your website is a good alternative. For B2C brands, think of testimonials a little more loosely. If you’re a clothing brand, these might take the form of photos of how other people styled a shirt or dress, pulled from a branded hashtag where people can contribute. Interesting stat: Visual storytelling as a medium is gaining popularity. Marketers said that the media formats that yielded the biggest ROI in 2024 were short-form video, images, and live-streaming video (in that order). How to Do Digital Marketing Define your goals. Identify your target audience. Establish a budget for each digital channel. Strike a good balance between paid and free digital strategies. Create engaging content. Optimize your digital assets for mobile. Conduct keyword research. Iterate based on the analytics you measure. 1. Define your goals. When you get started with digital marketing, it's critical to identify and define your goals since you’ll craft your strategy with them. For instance, if your goal is to increase brand awareness, you might want to focus on reaching new audiences via social media. Or maybe you want to increase sales on a specific product — if that‘s the case, it’s more important you focus on SEO and optimizing content to get potential buyers on your website in the first place. Additionally, if sales are your goal, you might test out PPC campaigns to drive traffic through paid ads. Whatever the case, it's easiest to shape a digital marketing strategy after you‘ve determined your company’s biggest goals.

Identify your target audience. We‘ve mentioned this before, but one of the biggest benefits of digital marketing is the opportunity to target specific audiences — however, you can’t take advantage of that benefit if you haven't first identified your target audience. Of course, it's important to note your target audience might vary depending on the channel or goal(s) you have for a specific product or campaign. For instance, perhaps you've noticed most of your Instagram audience is younger and prefers funny memes and quick videos. Meanwhile, your LinkedIn audience is older professionals looking for more tactical advice. In any case, having a thorough understanding of how users react to your content across different marketing channels is a must. You'll want to vary your content to appeal to each specific audience for maximized results. This is where data becomes all the more important. You can use platforms like Google Analytics to monitor website visitor behavior or native social media analytics tools to see how your followers engage with your social posts, for example. However, it’s best to access all this data within the same place — it helps spot any similarities or discrepancies between audiences and see how each strategy contributes to your overall marketing goals. This is where dedicated marketing analytics platforms, like HubSpot , come in handy. These solutions offer the tools necessary to see what content works best for each channel, examine how users move from one marketing channel to the other, as well as compare your marketing strategies’ results side-by-side. If you're starting from scratch, however, feel free to take a look at How to Find Your Target Audience . 3. Establish a budget for each digital channel. Your budget will depend on the elements of digital marketing you use. If you‘re focusing on inbound techniques like SEO, social media, and content creation for a pre-existing website, the good news is you don’t need a big budget at all. You can aim to create high-quality content your audience will want to consume, where the only investment you’ll need is your time. You can get started by hosting a website and creating content using Content Hub . For those on a tight budget, you can get started using WordPress hosted on WP Engine, using a simple theme from StudioPress, and building your site without code using the Elementor Website Builder for WordPress . With outbound techniques like online advertising and purchasing email lists, there is undoubtedly some expense. What it costs comes down to what kind of visibility you want to receive as a result of the advertising. For example, to implement PPC using Google AdWords, you‘ll bid against other companies in your industry to appear at the top of Google’s search results for keywords associated with your business. Depending on the keyword‘s competitiveness, this can be reasonably affordable or extremely expensive, which is why it’s a good idea to focus on building your organic reach, too. Interesting stat: 55.34% of marketers expect their marketing budget to stay the same in 2025, while 25.24% expect it to increase. 4. Strike a good balance between paid and free digital strategies. A digital marketing strategy likely needs both paid and free aspects to truly be effective. For instance, after spending time building comprehensive buyer personas to identify your audience’s needs and creating high-quality online content that converts them, you’ll likely see strong results despite minimal ad spend. However, if paid advertising is part of your digital strategy, then the results might come even quicker. Ultimately, aim to build your organic (or ‘free’) reach using content, SEO, and social media for more long-term, sustainable success. Natalie Eagling , CEO of Madison Taylor Marketing , a full-service marketing agency, says, “Performance drives the balance between free and paid digital marketing strategies. Long gone are the days where half of our marketing dollars are wasted.” According to Eagling, free strategies tend to build brand and community — two vital pillars of a successful strategy. While free tactics are “hard to see value from, the paid strategies are the fuel. They propel the free strategies,” she says. Natalie adds that the agency uses brand lift studies or correlates data from paid campaigns that have also had free strategies running alongside them to show clients that combining both can yield more powerful results. So, when in doubt, try both, and iterate on your process as you learn which channels — paid or free — perform best for your brand. 5. Create engaging content. Once you know your audience and have a budget, it's time to start creating content for the various channels you will use. This content can be social media posts, blog posts , PPC ads, sponsored content, email marketing newsletters, and more. To create conversion-focused content consider using content marketing software . With this software, you can utilize an AI-powered content writing tool, repurpose blog posts into content for other channels, and improve your content quality by optimizing it with built-in SEO recommendations. 6. Optimize your digital assets for mobile. Another key component of digital marketing is mobile marketing. In fact, smartphone usage as a whole accounts for 69% of time spent consuming digital media in the U.S., while desktop-based digital media consumption makes up less than half — and the U.S. still isn‘t mobile’s biggest fan compared to other countries. This means optimizing your digital ads, web pages, social media images, and other digital assets for mobile devices is essential. If your company has a mobile app that enables users to engage with your brand or shop for your products, your app falls under the digital marketing umbrella, too. Those engaging with your company via mobile devices need to have the same positive experience as they would on a desktop. This means implementing a mobile-friendly or responsive website design with Content Hub to make browsing user-friendly on mobile devices. It might also mean reducing the length of your lead generation forms to create a hassle-free experience for people downloading your content on the go. As for your social media images, it's important to always have a mobile user in mind when creating them, as image dimensions are smaller on mobile devices, and text can be cut off. There are lots of ways you can optimize your digital marketing assets for mobile users, and when implementing any digital marketing strategy, it's hugely important to consider how the experience will translate on mobile devices. By ensuring this is always front-of-mind, you‘ll be creating digital experiences that work for your audience, and consequently achieve the results you’re hoping for. 7. Conduct keyword research. Digital marketing is all about reaching targeted audiences through personalized content — all of which can't happen without effective keyword research . Conducting keyword research is critical for optimizing your website and content for SEO and ensuring people can find your business through search engines. Additionally, social media keyword research can also help market your products or services on various social channels. You‘ll still want to conduct keyword research even if you don’t have a full-time SEO strategist. Try creating a list of high-performing keywords related to your products or services, and consider long-tail variations for added opportunities. 8. Iterate based on the analytics you measure. Finally, to create an effective digital marketing strategy for the long term, it's vital your team learn how to pivot based on analytics. For instance, perhaps after a couple of months, you find your audience isn't as interested in your content on Instagram anymore — but they love what you're creating on X. Sure, this might be an opportunity to re-examine your Instagram strategy as a whole, but it might also be a sign that your audience prefers a different channel to consume branded content. Alternatively, perhaps you find an older web page isn't getting the traffic it used to. You might consider updating the page or getting rid of it entirely to ensure visitors are finding the freshest, most relevant content for their needs. In any case, having access to all of this data in the same place through platforms like HubSpot analytics can be a godsend. You can track performance across multiple channels within easy-to-digest dashboards, compare their results side-by-side, and get all the data necessary to quickly spot new opportunities and adjust your strategy. Interesting stat: According to marketers , a data-informed marketing strategy helps their team understand which marketing strategies are the most effective. This information also allows marketers to understand the ROI of their marketing efforts and reach their target audience most effectively. And 8 out of 10 (82%) say that having a single source of truth for their marketing data is beneficial to their organization. However, data privacy changes such as GDPR and Google’s decision to phase out third-party cookies have left a mark. 88% of marketers say that data privacy changes impacted their marketing strategy over 2024. Digital marketing provides businesses with incredibly flexible opportunities for continuous growth — but it's up to you to take advantage of them. I'm ready to try online marketing. Now what? If you‘re already doing digital marketing, you’re likely reaching some segments of your audience online. No doubt you can think of some areas of your strategy that could use a little improvement, though. That's why we created a step-by-step guide to help you build a digital marketing strategy that‘s truly effective, whether you’re a complete beginner or have a little more experience. Next, let’s look at some examples of digital marketing that will be sure to inspire you. Digital Marketing Examples Dove’s “These Legs” - Video Marketing #ShotoniPhone - User-Generated Content Tide’s “Stains Happen to the Best of Us” - Video Marketing Topicals - Email Marketing Ashley White - Affiliate Marketing Samsonite - Search Engine Marketing Yes Williamsburg - Sponsored Ad HubSpot Blog - Content Offers For Keeps Bookstore - Local Business SEO 1 . Dove’s “These Legs” - Video Marketing As we continue to learn how body shaming affects young girls and teenagers in sports, Dove decided to send a message with the “ These Legs ” campaign. The purpose is to increase awareness of how damaging words can be and how they can negatively impact self-esteem. Criticizing young girls for their body type can lead many of them to quit sports. This is an excellent example of what marketing content can look like when you understand your audience intimately. By knowing its audience of real women, many of them parents, Dove brought light to this issue. What I like: Dove's campaign shows the importance of knowing your audience to create relatable, understandable, and compelling content. 2. #ShotoniPhone - User-Generated Content This campaign by Apple has been in existence for around a decade now. Periodically, the company releases photography challenges inviting people to share their best images clicked using the iPhone — the winning photos come with perks. Apart from this, Apple posts user-generated content created using the hashtag on its Instagram handle, such as the image below shot by @keltorrance . The overall campaign has seen massive success — there are 31 million posts on Instagram using the hashtag. What I like: The #ShotoniPhone challenge is a great example of a campaign that is engaging and simple enough for users to participate in on their own. When creating a challenge or trend to promote your brand, remember K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Sweetheart).

Tide’s “Stains Happen to the Best of Us” - Video Marketing The “ Stains Happen to the Best of Us ” campaign by Tide for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games creatively uses humor, relatability, and celebrity features in this ad. Spills can happen at any place, at any time, and to anyone — elite Olympians included — and Tide is always there to lend a hand to restore your outfit to its original cleanliness. It’s also a great example of timely and relatable advertising tied to a current event. 4 . Topicals - Email Marketing Topicals , a skincare company, uses email marketing as part of a digital marketing strategy. The image below displays a marketing email that advertises a subscribe and save deal, where people get 20% off refills if they choose to subscribe. Source Pro tip: Notice how Topicals uses bold letters and colors to emphasize their deals and CTA button. Make sure to do the same in your own emails. 5 . Ashley White - Affiliate Marketing Ashley White is an esthetician who uses affiliate marketing. In her X profile, she includes a link to a personal Linktree page where she shares referral codes and discounts for people who shop with her codes and links. Source What I like: As Ashley White markets herself as an ambassador for these companies, the businesses generate brand awareness. Someone visiting her Linktree might be inspired to try a new brand, and an influencer recommendation can make this inspiration even more powerful. 6 . Samsonite - Search Engine Marketing Search engine marketing is a great example of digital marketing, where brands bid on keywords and showcase ads for their products in SERPs when someone queries a related keyword. The image below is an example from Samsonite , where a query for the word “luggage” surfaces various luggage options from known brands that have created ads to feature their products front and center in search results. Source 7 . Yes Williamsburg - Sponsored Ad Yes Williamsburg uses native advertising within its Instagram feed to share a paid sponsorship with a local Brooklyn business. The Reel is tagged as a paid partnership, but it appears organically in a user's feed like a standard post. The ad is also in line with Yes Williamsbug’s usual content of sharing information about unique local businesses for people to try. Pro tip: Today's audiences (especially Gen-Z) do not like to be blatantly advertised to, so creating content that feels organic and natural is more helpful than content that feels like an advertisement. 8 . HubSpot Blog - Content Offers Content offers are a form of digital marketing where businesses share helpful content with site visitors that it knows will benefit them. For example, the HubSpot Blog often features content offers and learning material for people to learn more about the blog topic. In this blog post — Customer Journey Maps: How To Create Really Good Ones [Examples + Template] — readers can download free templates to help them get started on creating a customer journey map. Source 9 . For Keeps Bookstore - Local Business SEO A search engine optimization strategy for many local businesses is an optimized Google My Business profile to appear in local search results when people look for products or services related to what you offer. For Keeps Bookstore , a local bookstore in Atlanta, GA, has optimized its Google My Business profile for local SEO so it appears in queries for “atlanta bookstore.” Source AI and Digital Marketing In my opinion, artificial intelligence is here to stay — particularly in marketing. 1 in 2 marketers (50.17%) see AI working in conjunction with marketers, assisting them in performing most of their job duties. And what are the various tasks AI can help with? Numerous. But the top four AI use cases are: Content creation (using generative AI to write copy, create images, get ideas, etc.) Learning how to do things (using generative AI to learn an Excel function, debug SQL code, etc.) Data analysis/reporting (using generative AI to analyze or manipulate marketing data) Research (using generative AI for market research, finding datasets, summarizing articles, etc.) So, it’s not surprising that 71.27% of marketers say that AI has had a somewhat to very significant impact on their marketing role. And while 47.18% have a clear understanding of how to use AI in their marketing strategy, there’s also a challenge. A little over half (51.80%) of the marketers surveyed feel overwhelmed by the prospect of implementing AI tools into their daily processes/workflows. In the end, balance is key. There are tons of digital marketing strategy courses that provide lessons on the fundamentals when using AI. It’s vital to look at AI as not a be-all and end-all solution but rather as a tool to simplify and quicken a digital marketer’s work. Integrate Digital Marketing Into Your Strategy Any opportunity where you can connect to your audience is an opportunity to convert a lead or acquire a customer. I feel that digital marketing creates so many more of those opportunities by allowing you to reach prospective buyers through a wide variety of channels. Whether it’s social media platforms, websites, text messages, or any online medium, it’s an invaluable way to promote your business, service, or product.

Content marketing is a type of inbound marketing that attracts customers and builds loyalty, making it effective for customer retention . Key content formats: Blogs Emails Videos Social posts Content marketing definition: What is content marketing? Content marketing is the development and distribution of relevant, useful content—blogs, newsletters, white papers, social media posts, emails, videos, and the like—to current and potential customers. When it’s done right, this content conveys expertise and makes it clear that a company values the people to whom it sells. The consistent use of content marketing establishes and nurtures relationships with your prospective and existing customers. When your audience thinks of your company as a partner interested in their success and a valuable source of advice and guidance, they’re more likely to choose you when it’s time to buy. Businesses with blogs see 67% more leads and branded videos drive 88% of purchases. Why is content marketing important? Content marketing is a go-to tactic that’s proven to work. Also, it provides a competitive advantage. Take a look at what the data says about content marketing: Businesses with blogs get 67% more leads than other companies. 67% of business to business (B2B) marketers say B2B content marketing increases engagement and the number of leads they generate . 88% of people credit branded videos for convincing them to purchase a product or service. Content marketing benefits businesses in many ways. When done right, an effective content marketing strategy can: Increase online visibility . A content strategy can help you attract more customers and website visitors, especially when people are constantly looking for solutions to their pain points. Offering educational and informative content about a topic they’re interested in can help you increase visibility online through your website or social media accounts. Generate more leads . You can increase leads when content marketing is used to drive traffic. Since educating customers builds trust and helps them feel more comfortable purchasing from your business, you can generate more leads and start to develop relationships with potential shoppers. Boost loyalty . Loyalty is essential in marketing and business because the more loyal your customers are, the more repeat purchases they’ll make. Offering content that informs consumers can help them begin to build trust with your brand and see you as a thought leader. Improve authority . Developing content is ideal for improving authority and becoming a thought leader in your industry. Not only does content help you build trust, but it can position your brand as the most authoritative on a particular topic. How content marketing works Your business can use content marketing to attract leads, make a case for your product or service when someone is researching what to buy, and close sales. To use it effectively, you’ll need to deliver the right content at each stage of the sales cycle—from awareness through consideration to purchase. If this sounds complicated, don’t worry: Approaching content this way actually simplifies the process. Here’s how companies use content marketing in each stage of the sales cycle to engage and sell. Awareness stage At the first stage of the sales process, your content should focus on the top concerns of your audience. Writing about their pain points, challenges, and questions gives you the best chance of engaging with them. Content at the awareness stage should be educational, how-to advice. Save your selling for the consideration and closing phases. The best content for this stage includes articles, blog posts, e-books, videos, and newsletters. Examples: A restaurant writes a blog post about how to plan a menu for a graduation party in the spring. A bike touring company creates a short video on the topic “3 Ways to Choose the Right Bike Trip.” An architecture firm creates an e-book called “Questions to Ask Before Hiring an Architect.” Consideration stage In the consideration stage, content should offer a hybrid of helpful information and marketing. It should educate the reader about what features or functions to look for and how various features address their needs. Of course, your content should lean toward what your business offers. The best content for this stage includes case studies , how-to articles, how-to videos , and checklists or worksheets. Examples: A cloud-based phone system company creates a checklist entitled “8 Ways to Improve Your Phone Customer Service” that details the features and functions that make great customer service possible. A landscaping company creates case studies about “The Biggest Mistakes Most People Make When They Hire a Landscaper.” A catering company features case studies of successful events with a focus on the benefits they offer, such as “How to Accommodate Food Allergies at Your Next Event,” or “How to Ensure Your Caterer Uses Sustainable Practices.” Closing stage Content marketing plays an important role when a prospect is close to buying. At this stage, you can focus on sales, as long as you continue to drive home why you’re the best choice rather than just how great your services or products are. Your central message here should be your expertise, knowledge, and the differentiating benefits of what you sell. Best content for this stage: case studies, user-generated content, buyer’s guide, product video, research report Examples: A consulting firm creates a research report proving that businesses that engage in strategic planning, assessments by outsiders, and other services—shaped by what services it offers—experience higher growth. A design agency creates short videos showcasing the variety in its work across different industries to demonstrate its diverse expertise. An orthodontist practice encourages patients to contribute testimonials about its state-of-the-art equipment and top-notch service. Success in content marketing comes from knowing your readers and creating valuable, well-placed content they’ll want to engage with. How to get started with content marketing Content marketing can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. A successful content marketing campaign should be manageable and sustainable. Take these steps to get started: Identify your audience To create content for a particular reader, you need to have a clear idea of their priorities, challenges, and preferences. If you have detailed descriptions of your various segments, choose 1 or 2 to write for. Otherwise, craft profiles of your audience members and prospects before starting. Determine the right formats The right format corresponds with what stage of the sales cycle you’re creating content for. Another important consideration includes what formats will best help you showcase value. For some, this will be a video; for others, a checklist. An audience will judge your content on its quality, and they should. Identify the right resource, internal or external, to create this work. Regardless of who creates it, hire a professional proofreader to review anything before it goes out the door. Determine how you’ll distribute Will you post content on your site, email it to people, or print it for an event? Start with “where” you know your audience is likely to be , and choose formats that make sense. For example, an article makes sense to send via an email, a checklist or worksheet can be posted on social media, and a buyer’s guide is a good follow-up to a pitch. Choose a sustainable schedule Once you know who your target readers are and the best formats for every stage in the sales cycle, create a short-term (3-6 months) plan. It’s easy to develop a content marketing plan that’s overly ambitious. However, the plan you design should have content elements you can realistically make based on your budget and resources. Keep track of how long it takes you to create each piece of content so that you can build that time into your schedule. Follow best practices Compelling content is clearly written and doesn’t contain jargon that only you and your peers will know. It should also include detailed how-to advice. A short, relevant, actionable piece of content is best. Craft compelling content that resonates with your audience Find out how to create irresistible social media content that solves problems, teaches skills, and keeps your audience engaged and coming back for more. Read the Article Content marketing and SEO Content marketing makes it easy for good prospects to find your business. However, you can boost your efforts with search engine optimization (SEO) . Here are a few important best practices: Keywords are the foundation of your SEO effort. These all-important words and phrases are the terms a prospect types into a search engine when they’re looking for a company, product, or service. When you include the right keywords in your content, you’ll attract more traffic . The best keywords are: Plain-language: language your audience uses to describe their pain points and needs Relevant: keywords that match the expertise, products, and services you provide Specific: a combination of your focus, industry expertise, prospect pain points, and other relevant details SEO has evolved so that search success depends in part on how well your content does what it says it’ll do. Search engines review content copy, assess its relevance, and determine whether it delivers on what the headline promises. Because of the importance search engines place on copy, using keywords throughout your content is important. Use the following guidelines: Focus on 1 to 2 keywords. Avoid “keyword stuffing” by writing about what matters to your prospects with a focus on just a few keyword phrases. Use keywords in the title. Make what the article is about clear and explicit. Use keywords throughout. Find a way of naturally incorporating your keywords into your content. Stay on topic. Good-quality content that provides advice related to a headline will perform best. Social media and content marketing Once you have content, it’s time to get the word out about it. Social media — Facebook , LinkedIn , YouTube , Twitter , Medium, Instagram , and others —is a proven and easy way to promote your content. You write a post and link to your content, and then voila! People are engaged. You can do this through 3 steps: Focus on high-potential channels. The best social media outlets for you are the ones frequented by your audience. Consider the big, popular channels, as well as smaller, industry-focused ones that are likely to connect you with good prospects. Ask your audience what channels they favor and build a manageable list based on their preferences. Craft your copy to fit the channel. Each social media channel has a level of professionalism versus fun, an accepted voice, and other details all its own. Before you write posts for a channel, spend some time reviewing posts to familiarize yourself with these details. Then, give your posts some of your own company spirit. Test and modify your approach. A winning social media promotion effort involves trial and error. Track responses from the various channels for quantity and quality. Fewer high-potential engagements may mean a channel is a good fit, as opposed to a slew of clicks that never turn into an audience.

Social media marketing is poised to get even bigger results than ever. Data from our 2024 Social Media Content Strategy Report shows consumers of all ages are engaging more than ever with brands on social media. Dynamic content, especially short-form video formats will become the primary focus, with 84% of social users having an Instagram profile and 61% using Instagram to find their next purchase. Influencer marketing will be a driving force for brands in 2025 as they integrate influencer content more intentionally for a more effective multi-channel approach. This will include edutainment , i.e. content that educates and entertains, which is also poised to be the most engaging of all brand content on social. Brands like UK-based financial giant Barclay’s are already engaging their audiences with educational content on their social media to meet consumers where they are and build brand trust. What is a social media marketing strategy? A social media marketing strategy is a comprehensive plan that integrates your social media efforts with your team’s goals and broader business objectives. This alignment ensures that your activities are optimized for performance and deliver measurable results that contribute to your overall marketing success. A well-defined social media marketing strategy also sets clear boundaries around your team’s time and expertise. Social media is a unique channel, and while nearly everyone uses it, this widespread usage often leads people to overestimate their expertise. Social media managers often face requests to share content that doesn’t align with the overarching strategy or audience interests. Not to mention proving social media ROI to ensure leadership teams can see the value of social and its benefits in terms of reach and revenue. Having a defined social media strategy helps navigate such requests, and so does having clearly defined metrics to prove the impact of social to executives. A social media management tool with capabilities such as Social Listening , Post Scheduling and Analytics and Reporting can help with this by enabling social teams to stay targeted and impactful. Why should you have a social media marketing strategy? This question can feel like a bit of a no-brainer to marketers that live and breathe social. Building a sustainable social media strategy requires understanding both current best practices and the context of social, a perspective Sprout has developed over 15 years helping brands succeed. That said, being able to clearly articulate the advantages of a cohesive social media strategy is crucial for securing buy-in from other stakeholders. Here’s how a well-defined social media strategy benefits your brand and business: It increases brand awareness and engagement According to The 2025 Sprout Social Index™ , 90% of consumers use social media to keep up with trends and cultural moments. Amid a fractured cultural landscape, social media has emerged to fill a seemingly endless need for content. And when brands commit to a cohesive social media marketing strategy, they develop the consistency needed to form a brand identity that cuts through the noise to resonate with a target audience. The rise of influencer marketing has further enabled brands to deepen their reach and drive meaningful engagement. According to the Q1 2025 Sprout Pulse Survey , 90% of marketers reported that sponsored influencer content performed better in terms of engagement compared to organic content posted on their brand accounts. It promotes brand trust and authenticity Social’s impact on brand trust is palpable, particularly for younger consumers. According to a Q2 2024 Sprout Pulse Survey, 78% of consumers surveyed agree that a brand’s social media presence has a larger impact on whether or not they trust that brand. That number goes up to 88% for Gen Z . What influences that trust the most? The content you post on social. But having a social media presence isn’t enough. Consumers also want authentic content from brands they follow. The 2025 Sprout Social Index™ showed consumers rank authenticity and relatability as two out of the three most important brand content traits. It supports performance measurement Your social media marketing strategy creates the infrastructure needed to prove the ROI of your efforts. Without one, you may be able to report on social media KPIs , but it’ll be much harder to showcase how they align with strategic objectives. For example, say you work with an automotive brand and one of your top business objectives is to increase market share with parents of young children. With that in mind, you can develop a strategic content pillar around this specific audience, and report on the performance of those posts over time. With a social listening tool , you can even measure how your brand’s share of voice stacks up against key competitors. This is a highly effective way to gauge your brand’s visibility and market share within your industry. Learn more about social listening tools It drives revenue Our Q2 2024 Pulse Survey also found that social media is the top channel for product discovery, with 81% of consumers surveyed using the channel to shop around for their next purchase. As social commerce adoption continues to skyrocket in the US and abroad, social media now supports a full-funnel experience. Even B2B brands are using social media to enhance lead generation and drive pipeline growth. For example, when Simpli.fi , an advertising success platform, integrated employee advocacy into their social media strategy, the company realized $90,000 in earned media value in three months. Benefits of social media marketing for your business needs Social media marketing transcends industries and offers businesses a dynamic platform for brand amplification, customer engagement and strategic growth. From healthcare to retail—social media marketing fosters competitive agility and cultivates brand awareness and trust to drive sustained market influence. It also provides key social data that gives businesses nuanced audience insights in almost real-time. These insights can influence the entire organization through customer-centric data. Plus, because social media marketing enables quick and hyper-targeted access to your demographic at a fraction of the time and cost traditional marketing takes, it drives a more enhanced ROI for the business. We spoke to Penn State Health , a multi-hospital academic health system serving the central Pennsylvania region to understand how social media has been instrumental in enabling them to achieve their business goals. Appeal to social-savvy customers To say that social media has transformed the way customers interact with a business is an understatement. Most customers are social-savvy today. Even baby boomers are on social media for news, entertainment and brand interaction. According to The 2024 Content Strategy Report, 74% of Baby Boomers have profiles on YouTube and Instagram, while Facebook has the highest—91%. The popularity of user-generated content, influencers and content creators has further bolstered experience-focused brand interactions that consumers crave. This has leveled the field between B2C and B2B brands. You need to meet consumers where they are in their fast-paced lives—and social gives them that opportunity. As Amy Peiffer, social media lead at Penn State Health aptly puts it, “People’s needs extend well beyond nine to five when somebody is in a clinic office picking up a phone and when people need answers to their questions. Often they go to social media because it’s the communication platform that they’re most familiar with and meets them at the times that they are working nine to five themselves. They may not necessarily have time to pick up the phone during the day.” As with all regulated industries, the Penn State Health social team adheres to strict protocols when communicating with patients or caregivers on social. HIPAA regulations mean it does not answer specific health condition questions on social. However, the team is able to direct audiences to the right resources to ensure they get all the support they need. “While healthcare is a highly regulated field that limits all we can use social media for, it at least allows us to be an intermediary to connect people to the right resources at the right times,” Peiffer explains. Uncover industry trends in real-time Social media is a goldmine of business intelligence made up of unfiltered, real-time conversations between consumers and brands, all of which you can tap into with Social Listening . With social listening, you can uncover trends and themes that reveal everything from customer favorites to areas where your company is falling short. This enables you to take action based on customer feedback. Sprout’s Listening tool also uses AI social media sentiment analysis so you can identify positive, negative and neutral chatter around you. You can automatically tap into negative brand mentions in comments and DMs to get targeted insights into where exactly you need to improve. Get comprehensive competitive analysis Perhaps one of the most valuable social media business benefits is the ability to study your competitors. You can use competitor analysis tools to help you understand your competition. What are they currently promoting? What sort of ads are they running? How is your content strategy different from theirs? By conducting social competitive analysis , you can uncover opportunities to experiment with your own content or advertising. For example, maybe you notice that your competitors are crushing it with Facebook Ads but their Instagram presence is lacking. In turn, you might explore influencer marketing or user-generated content campaigns for the sake of standing out from the crowd. You can look at your competitors’ social performance in a cinch with Sprout’s tools. Our competitor and sentiment analysis reports allow you to monitor growth and engagement to ensure that you aren’t falling behind. Through this analysis, you can also discover which pieces of your own content are earning the most engagement. Understanding your top-performing content is key to understanding how to break through the noise in your industry. Provide better customer service Customers expect quick communication and authentic engagement from brands when they reach out to them for grievances or solutions. And businesses understand this. They know they need to go beyond expectations to deliver social customer service that supports long-lasting relationships. According to the Sprout Social Index™ , 53% of brands say customer service contributes to the organization’s social strategy. With more people using social media today, brands can have meaningful, forward-facing conversations with customers easily. Extend brand reach and engagement Another crucial benefit of social media marketing is that it helps you enhance brand engagement through employee advocacy . Our data shows that posts employees share have an 8x higher engagement rate than brand content. Plus, employee content has 20x greater reach than all organic channels combined. Take a listen to the video below to learn more. Gain more top-of-funnel leads Securing more top-of-funnel leads is another key social media business benefit. Billions of people are active on social media daily and there’s a large chance your audience is already online. Whether through paid ads or content promotion, you can attract more top-of-funnel leads by raising awareness for your brand. Having a social presence introduces people to what you’re selling and represents another way to score more sales. Even if these leads don’t make purchases directly through social, raising awareness could lead them to become full-fledged buyers later on. After all, they can’t buy until they know your brand exists. Take advantage of SEO to supercharge your brand Consistently publishing on channels relevant to your business signals that you’re active and open to new customers. Social also enables you to tap into the power of social media search engines when someone looks up your brand. Shares and click-throughs via social represent positive search signals to Google, making social a sizable traffic source. You can track your social traffic with tools like Google Analytics . Don’t neglect social media as a content distribution channel. A popular piece of content that scores hundreds of likes and shares can drive serious referral traffic to your site. Plus a piece of content that ranks high on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP) can bring in traffic too. You can optimize your social scheduling with Sprout’s patented ViralPost technology that ensures you’re utilizing optimal send times. Extend your media and investor relations efforts Social media has transformed so many industries, and communications professionals are familiar with the impact of these online spaces. Brands aren’t limited to traditional mediums like radio and print newspapers—you can use social media to supercharge your media relations and investor relations strategies. Journalists use networks like X to find sources and potential stories, so meet them where they are. Follow and engage with journalists who report for your publications of interest to build rapport. Then when the opportunity arises, you can pitch to them. Along with connecting with journalists and publications, you can bolster company announcements and accomplishments through social posts to catch the eye of investors. Similar to job candidates and reporters, investors use social media to learn about brands. Start Your Free Trial How to create a social media marketing strategy Now that we’ve seen the critical ways social media marketing can elevate your business, let’s walk through how to create a plan. Here’s our six-step process for developing a social media marketing strategy that drives results. Step 1: Set goals and establish KPIs Social media strategy planning starts with your goals. Whether you want to expand your team, build a larger following, or a more active community, taking the time to define your social goals is the first step to reaching them. The goals you set will inform the key performance indicators (KPIs) you track, and how much time and energy you’ll need to dedicate to your campaigns. Example social media goals for 2025 and beyond What really matters is that you set realistic social media goals . We recommend tackling smaller objectives that allow you to scale your social efforts in a way that’s both reasonable and affordable. Below are some examples of social media marketing goals that businesses of all shapes and sizes can pursue. Goal example 1: Increase brand awareness Brand awareness means getting your name out there. According to the Index, 93% of consumers agree it’s important for brands to keep up with online culture. Try to avoid solely publishing promotional messages and strike a good balance with authentic content that emphasizes your brand’s voice and story. The Index further found consumers favor brands that post original content and interact regularly with their audience. For example, in this TikTok video, Sani, a family-owned apparel company features a day in the life of the brand’s founders while visiting India for business. If you want to increase brand awareness, here are the social media metrics you’ll want to focus on: Reach : Post reach is the number of unique users who saw your post. How much of your content actually reaches users’ feeds? Impressions : At the post level, impressions are how many times a post is displayed to someone. Impressions are a good indicator of how popular a piece of content is, and that people may be viewing a post multiple times. Hashtag performance : What were your most-used hashtags? Which hashtags were most associated with your brand? Having these answers can help shape the focus of your content going forward. Video views: This may come off as a vanity metric. But on certain channels, like TikTok, views count as impressions and are therefore important to monitor. As you define your objectives and define these goals, it’s also important to consider the role of both organic and paid social media in your overall strategy. Goal example 2: Generate leads and sales Whether online, in-store or directly through your social profiles, followers don’t make purchases by accident. For example, are you alerting customers about new products and promos? Are you integrating your product catalog into your social profiles? Are you running exclusive deals for followers? Social media gives you an avenue to generate revenue. Here are the metrics you’ll want to track if you’re focused on lead generation and sales: Conversions: A conversion is when someone takes a desired action, like purchasing something from your site or signing up for an upcoming event. Conversion rate: Conversion rate measures how well your social ad or campaign is convincing people to take a desired action. Influencer ROI: This will tell you the revenue or profit you gain compared to the cost of the investment Employee Advocacy: This metric will tell you how many leads you generated from employee-promoted content Return on ad spend (ROAS) :  ROAS will inform on how your campaigns and ads are performing Goal example 3: Grow your brand’s audience Bringing new followers into the fold means finding ways to introduce your brand to folks who haven’t heard of you before. Growing your audience also means discovering conversations around your business and industry that matter the most. Digging through your social channels is nearly impossible without monitoring or listening for specific keywords, phrases or hashtags. Having a pulse on these conversations helps you expand your core audience (and reach adjacent audiences) much faster. Important audience growth metrics include: Follower growth: Your follower growth measures the net new followers you gained in a specific time period. Follower growth rate: The percentage that shows you how quickly your audience is actually growing—or slowing—within a certain time period. Goal example 4: Provide holistic customer care The Index shows most consumers believe the most memorable thing a brand can do on social media is respond to customers. This means companies need to experiment with messaging and content when approaching customer care . For example, does your team have a protocol for handling @-mentions and comments? Do you have templated responses to FAQs? Does your brand promote user-generated content and hashtags? Your customers can be your best cheerleaders, but only if you give them a reason to grab the megaphone. If you want to improve your business’ approach to social customer care, here are the customer service metrics you need to track: Average first reply time : The time it takes for your team to send out the first reply to an inbound customer message within business hours. Reply or response rate: The rate that brands respond to messages or comments that they receive on a daily basis. Resolution rate: The percentage of customer inquiries that are fully resolved. This metric can reveal how equipped your entire company is to address customer inquiries. Goal example 5: Drive traffic to your site to illustrate the ROI of social efforts The Index shows that marketing leaders plan to measure social media success with overall engagement, audience growth, social interactions, web visitors and share of voice. If you’re laser-focused on generating leads or traffic to your website, social media can make it happen. Whether through organic promotional posts or social ads, keeping an eye on the following metrics can help you better determine your ROI from social media : Website traffic : Monitoring website traffic can help you properly attribute increases to specific campaigns or viral posts. Social media referral traffic: This describes people who visit your website directly from social media pages and posts. Any combination of these goals is fair game and can help you better understand which networks to tackle, too. When in doubt, keep your social media marketing strategy simple rather than complicating it with too many objectives that might distract you. Pick one or two and rally your team around them.

Use this presentation template to pitch a compelling vision for your next campaign, initiative or annual strategy Get the deck template Step 2: Research your target audience and select your networks Making assumptions is bad news for marketers. Both leaders and practitioners can disprove assumptions from the valuable insights social data provides. With the right tool, marketers can quickly research their audience . No formal market research or data science chops are necessary. What you need to know about your audience to influence your social media marketing strategy is already available. You just have to know where to look. Remember: Different platforms attract different audiences. Social media demographics and benchmark statistics are great for understanding where your target audience lives, but it’s also important to understand the nuances of each social network so you can decide where your business needs to be. For the sake of narrowing down where you should spend your time, below is a quick overview of each of the major social platforms: X/Twitter Requiring minimal setup and providing a place to go back and forth with followers directly, there’s a reason why X remains one of the go-to platforms for customer service . If you’re trying to master the social media marketing basics of hashtags, tagging, brand voice and social media etiquette, look no further. Facebook With more than 3 billion users , Facebook is the world’s leading social media platform. It should be a part of your customer service strategy and marketing campaigns regardless of whether you’re a B2C or B2B business. The platform’s algorithms are much more sophisticated today and focus on showing users the most relevant, meaningful content based on inventory, signals, relevancy scoring and other factors. Plus with Meta investing in expanding advertising features within its short-video format feature Reels, the platform is poised to become a major network gone far beyond its humble origins of being a medium for social networking. Instagram Instagram is a network centered around visual content. From eye-popping photos to clever captions, it’s all about finding unique ways to show off what you’re selling. Whether you’re a regional business or one with a global presence, the platform offers you the creativity to explore different types of content to reach your audience. Check out how Australian garden center chain Bunnings uses Instagram to promote its products. Threads When Meta released Threads on July 5, 2023, the social network received over 100 million registrations less than a week after its launch, making it the most rapidly downloaded app ever. The launch of Threads sparked conversations about its role in the fediverse, or decentralized social media . But, for now, Threads is a text-based social network that users can sign up for through their current Instagram account. Users can post on mobile, but Threads is also available on desktop. Threads are great for brands who already have Instagram accounts because the sign-up process is pretty seamless. LinkedIn LinkedIn is a network laser-focused on business trends and networking, and so a goldmine for anyone networking in the B2B space. Looking to get in touch with an influencer, marketing manager or CEO? Chances are you can find them here. However, the benefits of LinkedIn marketing go beyond networking, such as content distribution and lead generation. We also have a guide for LinkedIn best practices so you can get full advantage of those benefits. Pinterest Pinterest marketing is insanely popular, especially among Gen Z and Millennials. Over 465 million people use this visual pinning platform every month to find inspiration and their next purchase.  Like Instagram, Pinterest thrives on imagery and inspirational content where products serve as the proverbial centerpiece. TikTok TikTok remains one of the most popular apps in the world. Along with its viral trends and niche communities, the short-form video app is known for its hyper-personalized algorithm that keeps users scrolling for hours. TikTok marketing has changed the game for brands, allowing them to connect with customers in an entirely new way. Looking for more in-depth data on other platforms? Explore key Snapchat statistics to understand its audience and usage trends. YouTube YouTube has gone beyond being a video-hosting platform, transforming into the world’s most popular search engine, second only to Google. And considering that video represents the top-performing type of content across nearly every social network, YouTube is a great place to house your videos and optimize them for search and lead generation. In fact, according to The 2024 Content Strategy Report, consumers want brands to post entertaining content but also content that educates them about their products and services, followed by influencer content and contests and giveaways. Picking networks for your social media marketing strategy There are more than 15 social media platforms your brand can use , but don’t spread yourself too thin. Consider those platforms that make the most sense based on your industry and target audience. Do your homework on your existing social media audience and focus on networks where your core audience is already active and determine how you can segment them. That’s why many brands use a social media marketing dashboard that provides an overview of who’s following you and how they interact with you on each channel. For example, Sprout’s analytics dashboard puts your audience demographics front and center. It highlights which social networks see the most activity, helping you ensure you spend your time on the right network. You can also use analytics to determine if you should create a new social media account . With Sprout, you can view X, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube and Pinterest data side-by-side in a customizable format that’s exportable by date range and profile. There are plenty of other sources of valuable audience data to supplement your social media insights. This includes your Google and email analytics, CRM, customer service platform, and even your best-selling products. All of the above will ultimately influence everything from your marketing messaging to how you’ll approach customer service or social commerce . Step 3: Create (and curate) timely & engaging social content No surprises here. Your social media marketing strategy hinges on your content. At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of what to publish based on your goals, audience and brand identity. You probably feel confident in which networks to cover, too. But what about your content strategy? Below are some tips, ideas and inspiration that can help. Defining your content strategy Coming up with a content strategy might seem like a lot of legwork, but in reality, it all boils down to your goals. For example, Nike builds its entire social media strategy around inspirational storytelling to foster a deep, emotional connection with its audience. Looking to educate your audience in the B2B space? Publish blogs, news and opinions relevant to your industry. Trying to push e-commerce products? Post action shots of your products and photos of others showing off your swag. Focused on customer service? Tips, shout-outs and company updates are fair game. To ensure your content remains focused and aligned with your brand’s objectives, you can build your content plan around a set of social media content pillars . Regardless of what you might post, coming up with a hashtag to couple with your content is a brilliant branding move. Hashtags can be used to get your attention and encourage people to share their photos interacting with your brand. Find your brand voice One of the best ways to stand out on social media is to have a distinct brand voice. Chances are you’ve seen a post from a particular brand that just feels like, well, theirs. The quippy, casual tone that makes Discord’s X presence beloved by casual users and moderators alike is a great example. The key is to present yourself as a human rather than a robot. Adopt a consistent brand voice and style that’s appropriate for your business. Bake timeliness into your strategy Timeliness is arguably more important than ever for marketers. Not only are you expected to put out fresh content regularly, but also to always be “on” for your followers. But you can’t always expect customers to operate on your clock. Plus, timeliness is a tall order when you’re strapped for resources or are part of a small team. As evidenced by our best times to post on social , brands have a lot of ground to cover in terms of frequency and how much content to push. It’s important to pay attention to the optimal times for engagement so you can automate the most tedious aspects of your social presence without having to worry about posting in real time. Another important factor is ensuring you respond to customer comments in a timely manner. If you’re strapped for time and have a small team, consider taking advantage of chatbots and AI & automation to ensure you’re engaged with your customers so you can serve and engage with customers when your team is offline, which leads us to our next point. Take advantage of short-form video Thanks to the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels , social video is booming. Short-form productions continue to dominate the social space across all platforms due to their high engagement rates. Thanks to advancements in DIY and remote video production , you don’t need massive budgets to be successful. All you need is a laptop or smartphone and a few tricks of the trade, like video length best practices and editing tools . Share posts that show off your brand’s uniqueness and human side Both personal and personable content should be a cornerstone of your social media marketing strategy. Don’t be afraid to remind followers of the humans behind your posts. According to the latest Index, consumers crave original, entertaining and humanizing content from brands. For example, Zoom has excellent original content on their Instagram and TikTok accounts, like this Reel that explores the different signs in the workplace: Step 4: Collaborate with influencers If you haven’t already, it’s time to tap into the power of influencer marketing . Social partnerships are very effective when executed correctly. They can help drive traffic to your website, produce compelling content and inspire purchase decisions. But consumers care about creators’ qualifications, so choose wisely. The two most important qualifications of content creators working with brands is their experience with the product/service and their authenticity. Identify creators who align with your brand and consider how they can help you craft stand-out content for your audience. What consumers want from influencer-brand collaborations According to the 2024 Influencer Marketing Report , consumers overall look to engage with influencers who align with their personal values (53%) and seem authentic (47%), even when posting sponsored content and taking part in brand campaigns . Across ages and genders, honest and unbiased content stops audiences mid-scroll, while aspirational content is least likely to catch their attention. However, the report also found that authenticity is losing its appeal among younger generations. While trust in influencers remains strong—and is even growing among younger consumers—only 35% of Gen Z value authenticity, compared to nearly half of Millennials, Gen X‌ and Baby Boomers. This indicates that younger generations are more aware of the influencer-brand relationship and how it influences their buying decisions, but they’re comfortable with it. Instead, they prioritize other indicators of trustworthiness, such as follower count, posting frequency‌ and community loyalty. Step 5: Bring other departments into the mix Social media teams have a unique advantage when it comes to understanding customer sentiment. You’re the eyes and ears for your brand online. Those insights can do more than just inform your marketing strategy. They can transform your business. Stand-out social media teams will approach cross-department collaboration with enthusiasm and intention. Which departments can benefit from social data? The short answer? All of them. Index data shows around three-quarters of marketing leaders already say organic and paid social marketing are top priorities for the organization. However, don’t bite off more than you can chew. Instead, start where you think you can make the most impact. Here are a few ideas to jumpstart your strategy. Human Resources Collaborating with human resources on social-first employer brand initiatives can do more than just fill open roles quickly. It can attract stronger, more qualified candidates as well. Many companies have embraced social recruiting strategies, such as publishing creative “we’re hiring” posts on LinkedIn to attract top talent. Sales Data from The 2023 Sprout Social Index™ notes marketers planned to track conversations and sales directly resulting from social efforts in 2024 to better connect the value of social to business goals. Sharing social insights with your sales organization can empower reps to work smarter in the context of increasingly digital customer journeys. Consider learning more about social selling to leverage the power of online networks even further. Product and merchandising You’ve probably received quite a few feature or product requests while managing your brand’s social inbox. With a social media management tool , you can distill those messages into actionable insights for your product or merchandising teams. These insights can complement existing roadmap research, creating a customer-focused plan that delights. Customer care Monitoring customer service metrics like average reply time, average wait time and response volume can help your social customer care team identify what’s working well and spot opportunities for improvement. Marketers are using social media customer service software to elevate their support strategies and get the most out of their tech stack. Step 6: Evaluate and improve your social media strategy By now you should have a big-picture understanding of your social media strategy. However, it’s important to adapt your strategy throughout the year. Without continuously analyzing your efforts, you’ll never know how one campaign did over another. Having a bird’s eye view of your social media activity helps put things into perspective. This means looking at your top-performing content and adjusting your campaigns when your content stalls . There’s no denying that a lot of social media is a matter of trial-and-error. Monitoring the metrics behind your campaigns in real time allows you to make small tweaks to your social media marketing strategy rather than sweeping, time-consuming changes. Doing social media marketing right starts with being diligent about your data. You can be reactive in the short term to get the most out of your running campaigns, and then proactively use these takeaways to inform your next strategy overhaul. To guarantee that you get in front of as many customers as possible, monitoring your growth is a major must-do. With Sprout, social reports can clue you in on everything from your top-performing content to how engaged your audience is. These reports are crucial for accountability and guaranteeing your numbers continue to tick upward. Reporting on data is also important for the sake of sharing valuable insights from social with your coworkers and colleagues. Remember that 60% of organizations use social data daily—be one of the brands that embrace it . Sharing this information in regular reports not only holds you accountable for your efforts but also highlights the impact and bottom-line results your social strategy produces. Based on your data, you can better assess whether your KPIs truly ladder up to your overarching company goals or whether they need to change. How do you maintain an effective social media marketing strategy? Maintaining an effective social media marketing strategy requires a balance of planning, execution‌ and continuous optimization. Here are focus areas you’ll need to pay attention to to ensure your strategy remains evergreen. 1. Secure executive buy-in and engagement Winning leadership buy-in is one of the most important factors that can ensure your social media marketing strategy is a success. Approaching it in a layered manner and showcasing how your social media strategy is impacting your business, with tangible data, can help. Show ROI : Use data and insights from social listening (e.g., customer sentiment, competitive analysis) to demonstrate the business impact of social media. Make it easy : Provide curated content and pre-drafted posts to simplify their participation. Highlight thought leadership : Position executives as industry leaders by sharing insights, trends, and personal perspectives on LinkedIn or other social media channels. Tie it in with employee advocacy : Encourage executives to engage organically by responding to comments and participating in conversations that align with company values. Plus, amplify your employee advocacy by encouraging employees to share brand content that’s already curated. 2. Ensure you’re not deviating from your set goals and KPIs Now that you have broader organizational support, create guardrails so you’re on track with your goals. To do this, it helps to define what success looks like—is it brand awareness, engagement, lead generation‌ or conversions? Align your KPIs (followers, reach, CTR, engagement rate) with your objectives. 3. Build on your influencer marketing efforts The 2024 Influencer Marketing Report found 49% of consumers make purchases at least once a month because of influencer posts. This means influencer marketing can have the most impact on your business compared to your other social efforts. To ensure you get the most of your influencer ROI , integrate an influencer marketing platform into your existing tech stack. This will help you automate data collection and analysis and enable you to track and measure the impact of influencer-led campaigns on your revenue. Sprout Influencer Marketing integrates into your martech stack seamlessly so you can search for the right influencers and collaborate with them, streamline influencer workflows, and manage influencer compensation and campaigns, all through a unified dashboard. 4. Take advantage of AI & automation Use AI for smarter workflows and get time back to focus on strategy. Use AI and automation for content recommendations, content creation, automated posting and sentiment analysis for brand insights. Similarly, implement chatbots on your social channels for instant customer interaction and improve customer support. This video highlights how Sprout’s Bot Builder helps businesses. You can also use AI to automate reporting to track performance efficiently and provide different teams with the exact data and insights they need. Social media marketing gives you access to real-time data on customer experience and shifting consumer preferences. Having this data at your fingertips ensures you’re making decisions that go beyond personal feelings and anecdotes and are based on tangible evidence. “With this comes a greater ability to show that specific initiatives, types of content, themes or campaigns have or have not supported KPIs that we’ve identified as important to what we’re trying to achieve. When you have that level of data available, and in an easy-to-set-up way, it unleashes a lot of power in your decision-making and decision backing.” Peiffer explains. 5. Use in-depth reporting to prove social ROI One of the benefits of social media marketing is that you get comprehensive audience and campaign performance metrics easily and quickly to ensure you’re aligned with your primary goals. For example, with Sprout’s My Reports tool, you know exactly what metrics align with your business priorities and how to turn that engagement into tangible results. This makes it easy to prove your social ROI because now you can easily showcase how your social marketing strategy is performing, driving leads, and helping with your brand’s integrated marketing strategy. Rachael Goulet, Director of Social Media at Sprout Social explains how her team uses My Reports. Since My Reports are also highly customizable, it’s easy for social media managers to pull the exact KPIs leadership teams and stakeholders are interested in and reveal the impact of social on the brand and business. “When you have five minutes to present to other key stakeholders at the executive level, they are looking for fast, quick takeaways. Sprout allows us to pull just that much information that’s customizable for those key stakeholders. We can even automate it, such that, if they have a monthly check-in, for example, and they just want to know how some of our strategic priority areas are performing at that time, we can pull KPIs specific to those areas.” Peiffer notes. Through reporting on social data you’re also able to achieve greater transparency and accessibility through meaningful metrics. “Data-driven decision-making is being built into the culture beyond our social media and web team, because we can build greater transparency and accessibility using reporting and social listening dashboards,” she says. “Because these reports are highly visual, and can be as robust or simple as we need them to be to communicate with key stakeholders, it allows us to empower really anyone to communicate the results of our efforts on social media in a way that is meaningful to their goals—whether that be an executive to a governance council, a director to our dean or an account manager to a service line physician,’ Peiffer adds. 6. Focus on audience segmentation and tracking Social media marketing enables businesses greater segmentation and tracking through platform-specific data and insights from AI-powered tools like Sprout. You can target audiences based on demographics, interests, behaviors and even sentiment analysis through social listening. Plus, advanced targeting features like custom and lookalike audiences can ensure your ads reach the most relevant users. As Sprout customers, Penn State Health has used Sprout’s Tagging feature to help benefit from improved segmentation and tracking for their marketing and communications objectives on social media. “The tagging architecture within Sprout has really allowed us to have greater segmentation and tracking for those separate and distinct audiences and also the variety of content that we’re putting out,” Peiffer notes. AI-powered analytics further helps track engagement, conversions and customer journeys. This will enable you to tailor content to audience personas and optimize campaigns in real-time for better social ROI and audience alignment. 7. Optimize your content strategy Content that resonates with your customers, including user-generated content and success stories, often goes hand-in-hand with higher engagement and conversion rates. Social gives you the advantage of curating this impactful content quickly. For example, you can monitor mentions and tags to uncover positive customer interactions and then share them on your social media channels to nurture brand trust. Many brands also curate customer photos to use throughout their marketing campaigns. This is why having a branded hashtag is so important. By encouraging your customers to tag their content, you can find shareable posts that your followers will love while also making a connection with your customers. You can manage this process effectively through a dedicated UGC platform . A Publishing Calendar can also be useful to ensure your curated content is posted at a consistent rate to ensure you have a steady brand social media presence. However, when it comes to cyclical content, constantly creating awesome content can be taxing—a challenge all brands face. AI in social media can help overcome this block and even enhance creativity. “There’s only so many ways over time I can think to say it’s National Doctors Day, thank a doctor who has made a difference in your life,” Peiffer explains. “As social media managers, we can use tools like generative AI to get ‘unstuck’ in these creative blocks and tailor it to our own brand voice and audience preferences,” she adds. Sprout’s AI tools have made a difference in how Penn State Health’s social team creates brand content. “I appreciate that Sprout gives several options when generating text. I’m sometimes pulling from this piece and adding it to another, or it just inspires a wholly separate thought and I’m writing something entirely different. That inspiration saves time and helps find a new way to say the same thing,” Peiffer notes. Generative AI tools like Sprout Social’s AI Assist in Compose can help you create content easily. All you have to do is add a few thoughts or drop a link and you get multiple caption options in different tones. Similarly, the Suggestions by AI Assist capability helps improve social media posts by instantly generating multiple variations of the post or adjusting its tone. Yet another important way to optimize your content strategy is to have a balanced mix of videos, infographics, carousels and user-generated content to create multi-format content and keep engagement high. It’s also important to align content with your brand persona and not jump on every trend you see on social. The 2025 Sprout Social Index™ revealed this as one of the top things consumers want brands to stop doing. 8. Champion workflow efficiencies to empower your team Brands need to be constantly accessible to customers because with social, customers are just a touch of a button away from brands they want to reach. This can also mean overwhelmed social teams balancing customer support, content management and slicing and dicing data for reporting. However, with an intuitive social media management solution, this daunting task can become easy as pie. According to Amy, Penn State Health’s social team was able to build custom reports faster and more efficiently, such that the time to build customer reports dropped by nearly 70%. They also reduced errors by 80% and troubleshooting turnaround time from 3-5 days to within an hour. This collective efficiency helped save team resources as well. “We eliminated the need for an additional contractor-supported role due to efficiency gained for full-time team members,” Peiffer explains. This video explains how the Sprout team uses our own tool to save time and increase workflow efficiency. 9. Prioritize social customer care Per the latest Sprout Social Index™, among the top things customers want brands to start doing in 2025 is prioritizing quick, personalized customer care. Social Customer Care by Sprout Social helps brands achieve this. Whether it’s through Case management that enables global customer care teams to be on the same page or tools like Saved Replies that help deliver quick service while maintaining brand voice, you deliver the best customer experience ever, and more importantly, humanize your brand. Peiffer says, “What we found in years of inquiries was that there were certain themes and frequent requests to our social media pages. Using Sprout, we built Saved Replies that centralized how to locate those resources for our audiences, but could still be individualized and customized to impart that humanity to our social media communications, which I think is so important in health care. In Sprout, we’re able to unlock this potential and allow our team to focus on more strategic objectives.” 10. Engage and build community This brings us to customer engagement and building your own brand community. One of the ways to nurture a thriving brand community is to respond to comments and messages promptly. Tools like Sprout’s Smart Inbox or Message Alerts help you in doing that because they automatically categorize messages according to priority. Collaborate with brand advocates to extend your reach and infuse your social media with authentic, relatable content. Plus, encourage user participation through polls, Q&A and challenges. This will help you grow and sustain your brand’s community with loyal followers. 11. Analyze and iterate your efforts Analyze and track your efforts consistently. This includes testing your ad creatives, captions and posting times to ensure they are optimized for your audience. Tools like Sprout’s Suggestions by AI Assist and ViralPost ™ capabilities enable you to do just this. Analyze your content performance as well and use that data to refine your approach. With Sprout’s Tagging feature, you can pull tag-based reports that make it easy to assess what makes something resonate with your audience and see how it aligns with your strategic priority area. You can see what’s performing well and apply those data-backed learnings to other projects to build your annual campaigns. This approach has also helped Penn State Health win executive buy-in. “The ability to customize how specifically we want to be able to sort, filter and measure data has allowed us to build really enhanced reporting that provides sometimes real-time feedback to stakeholders in ways we haven’t always been able to,” Peiffer says. “It’s something that not only allows us to plan better as we’re laying out our campaigns and our social strategy for the year, but then also to go back and to report to others when they say, I don’t understand why you did this, or I don’t understand why we don’t do something else. We have the data and the insights available to communicate effectively why our decisions are what they are and to support them as we go forward,” she adds. Another important factor is to keep track of platform algorithm changes so you aren’t caught off-guard and adapt your strategy accordingly. This cohesive approach will also enable you to create benchmarks that you can lean on for future campaigns. Ready to make your social media marketing strategy future-proof?

Social media marketing strategy FAQs What is the role of social media tools in social media marketing strategy? Social media management tools are essential for streamlining and amplifying a social media marketing strategy. They automate repetitive tasks, provide critical data for informed decisions, and enable businesses to manage their presence across multiple platforms efficiently. Here’s the role of social media tools in a marketing strategy: Scheduling and Publishing: Social media management tools let you plan and schedule posts in advance. This ensures a consistent posting schedule without requiring you to manually post in real time, saving significant time and effort. Analytics and Reporting: These tools provide detailed insights into your performance. They track engagement, reach, and follower demographics, helping you understand what content works best and allowing you to adjust your strategy for a better ROI. Audience Listening and Monitoring: Social listening tools monitor conversations about your brand, competitors, and industry trends. This provides valuable insights into customer sentiment and helps you identify opportunities and address potential crises. Team Collaboration: For larger teams, social media management platforms provide a unified dashboard where team members can collaborate on content, manage customer inquiries, and ensure a consistent brand voice. Optimizing for ROI: Social media tools are crucial for proving the return on investment (ROI) of your efforts. They provide the data reports and custom dahsboards needed to show which campaigns are generating leads, driving sales, and contributing to overall business goals, justifying the investment in your social media strategy How do I measure the success of my social media marketing efforts? The success of social media marketing is measured by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with your business objectives. By tracking the right metrics, you can understand your audience, optimize your content, and demonstrate a clear return on investment (ROI). Here are five key metrics to measure the success of your social media marketing efforts: Engagement Rate: This measures how actively your audience interacts with your content. It’s calculated by dividing the total number of likes, comments, and shares by the number of followers. A high engagement rate shows your content is resonating with your audience. Reach and Impressions: Reach is the number of unique people who saw your content, while impressions are the total number of times your content was displayed. These metrics show how widely your brand’s message is being seen. Click-Through Rate (CTR): This metric measures the percentage of people who click on a link in your social media post. A high CTR indicates that your call-to-action (CTA) is effective and driving traffic to your website or a specific landing page. Conversion Rate: This tracks the percentage of users who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or downloading a guide, after clicking on a social media post. It directly links your social efforts to business results. Audience Growth Rate: The audience growth rate the pace at which your follower count is increasing over time. It helps you understand if your strategies are effectively attracting new followers and expanding your brand’s community.

Why should ecommerce websites care about SEO? How to create an ecommerce SEO strategy Best ecommerce SEO tools Ecommerce SEO FAQ Start your online business today. For free. Start for free Getting more traffic is top of mind for any ecommerce business. But how do you attract visitors to your online store without spending big on ads and marketing? The answer: by knowing how to harness ecommerce SEO. Ecommerce search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of fine-tuning your website to meet search engine best practices, which includes updating your content to reflect what your customers are searching for. Benefits of SEO for store owners include increased visitors, brand awareness, and sales. But with constant search engine algorithm updates, knowing how to approach search optimization can be difficult. This guide covers the basics of ecommerce SEO, including how to research keywords, structure your site, and create content for product pages. Equipped with this guide, and this SEO checklist , you’ll be set up to rank your store and reap some SEO rewards. What is ecommerce SEO? Ecommerce SEO is the process of increasing the visibility of an online store in search engine results pages ( SERPs ). Ecommerce websites use SEO as a strategy to generate more traffic, attracting visitors who input queries related to their products and brand. The tasks involved in ecommerce SEO marketing are varied. For example, creating optimized website content is one SEO task you might undertake. Your content could show up in relevant search results that catch the attention of new customers and guide them to purchase. For example, an ecommerce store like True Classic , which sells t-shirts, could improve its website SEO by optimizing collection and product pages. The most important ecommerce SEO functions As you begin the process of optimizing your online store, the most essential ecommerce SEO tasks to prioritize include: Optimizing collection and product pages Making sure product feeds are submitted via Google Merchant Center Building new collection pages to target new queries Other important tasks include: speeding up page load time , crafting detailed product descriptions , and doing backlink outreach . After prioritizing these SEO activities, you can consider creating informational content to provide additional value and traffic sources. This informational content, like blog posts or help center articles, should target queries that a customer would likely ask before purchasing an item. True Classic, for example, devotes an entire page to their different fabric options in detail so that shoppers can explore and get to know the products more deeply. Why should ecommerce websites care about SEO? When you search for something on Google, you’re taken to a search engine results page (SERP). There, you’ll find approximately 10 organic results : These organic results appear below paid ads (orange) and Google Shopping ads (purple): Ecommerce SEO is all about ensuring your product pages appear among the top organic search results on the first page of Google. Websites that don’t rank within the top 10 are rarely visited, and even those in positions three to five receive far less traffic than the top results. 😲 Worth noting: SEO company Backlinko found that only 0.63% of searchers click on websites listed on page two of Google search results. Backlinko also reported that the first result on a Google SERP gets 27.6% of all the clicks: backlinko.com In other words: SEO matters. The name of the game is to rank as high as possible on the first page of search engines like Google and Bing—both for search terms related to your products, as well as searches within your ecommerce niche market . How to create an ecommerce SEO strategy If you’re new to search engine optimization and want to increase your store’s ranking on Google, take a look at these six steps. They provide actionable tips for setting up good, basic ecommerce SEO on your website. Ecommerce keyword research On-page SEO for ecommerce Site architecture for ecommerce Technical SEO Google Merchant Center product feeds Publishing relevant informational content Link building 1. Ecommerce keyword research The first step in any ecommerce SEO strategy is to identify high-value search terms that your potential customers are using. You can do that through ecommerce keyword research , which can be conducted in a number of ways. Ecommerce keyword research is slightly different from traditional keyword research. While most sites care only about informational keywords, you’ll want to target a mix of informational and commercial keywords, like this: Informational keyword searchers are looking for answers, guides, and explanations. Blogs and content-heavy sites care most about these keywords. Many Shopify stores and other ecommerce sites have blogs too, but they also target keywords that show buying intent , like “raincoats for dogs.” Amazon and Google autocomplete predictions When you start to type a search query into Google, its autocomplete feature suggests relevant queries: These autocomplete suggestions can be a gold mine for keyword ideas, especially when you already have a few basic keywords in mind. (Don’t forget to check the related search queries at the bottom of the SERP, too.) Amazon autocomplete predictions You can complete a similar process on Amazon. The great thing about Amazon suggestions is that, unlike Google, they’re product-focused and can include filterable details such as price. Pay particular attention to long-tail keywords , which are longer and describe more specific items. The longer the keyword, the more specific it is. That means lower competition and, often, higher conversion rates. You can also check how Amazon (and other major ecommerce sites) structure content for visibility in search. Take a look at relevant product menus for keyword category ideas. Let’s say you sell women’s fashion items. If you find that category on Amazon, you can see all of the different ways Amazon sorts and organizes its products in that niche: Repeat this process for any other major competitors. Keyword research tools For more advanced keyword research, you’ll need a free SEO tool . The most popular is Ahrefs . These tools provide the ability to research and analyze keywords en masse. Let’s say you compete with BustedTees , a geeky t-shirt ecommerce store. Enter its domain into a keyword research tool like Ahrefs and click Organic keywords at the top: Scroll down to see all the keywords BustedTees currently ranks for. You’ll also find metrics like search volume and rank position. With an overview of your competitor’s SERP coverage, you can make an informed decision about where to compete for keywords. Choosing the right keywords for your store No ecommerce website can target every keyword. Based on your customers and products, you’ll need to decide which keywords to try to rank for. Consider the following factors: Long-tail versus head term keywords Head term keywords are very broad and usually very competitive. On the other hand, long tail keywords are more specific and have less competition, with usually a higher likelihood for conversion because of their relevance. Raven Tools Volume The higher a keyword’s search volume , the more potential traffic to your site. You can discover keyword search volume using Ahrefs or a free tool like Google Keyword Planner . Competition The lower the competition, the more likely you are to rank for a keyword. SEO tools will show you keyword difficulty/competition (KD). Relevancy How relevant is your product page or category page to the search term? This is a huge ranking factor that’s often neglected. Stick to keywords that your products would genuinely satisfy. You’re not foolin’ Google (and you shouldn’t try to trick your customers either). Intent Target keywords that show an intent to buy or learn about a product. Usually, you can evaluate search intent just by looking at a keyword. For example, if you own a bridal shop, which search has the more relevant intent: “ball gown wedding dresses” or “work dresses”? It’s also wise to look at what other sites are currently ranking for a search term; that’ll help make sure your keyword usage has the same search intent. Product types If you sell more than three of the same product type, target relevant keywords with a collection. If you sell fewer than three of the same product type, target keywords with each individual product page. 💡 The ultimate keyword? A high volume, low competition term that aligns with the content on your website. 2. On-page SEO for ecommerce Once you’ve done your keyword research and your site structure is ready to rock, it’s time to optimize the content on your two highest-value page types: Product category pages Product pages Ecommerce content basics If you’re using Shopify, you likely know that Shopify stores include several SEO features. Some are automatic: Canonical tags are included. Your website’s sitemap.xml and robots.txt files are generated. Themes generate title tags that include your store name. Themes have social media linking and sharing options. But other features require you to manually optimize your site: Edit the title tags, meta tags, and meta descriptions to include your keywords. Edit the alt text of product images to ensure it accurately describes visuals. Make sure your file names include keywords. Think carefully about the URLs for blog posts, webpages, products, and collections. When optimizing your title tags and descriptions, note that these are Google-facing. The primary goal is ranking on the first page. The secondary goal is convincing searchers to click through to your site. Modifiers like Deals, 20% Off, Free Shipping, Wide Selection, etc., can give you a boost when placed in the meta description (or title, if it fits) and help you tackle long-tail keywords. Ecommerce product descriptions In ecommerce SEO, Google and other search engines use the content on your page to decide which keywords to rank your page for and how high your page should rank for each keyword. If a product page has a short description and not much else, Google doesn’t have much to go on. Copying and pasting a description from a manufacturer or supplier is called duplicate content and is also advised against. Instead, write unique, comprehensive product descriptions that capture readers’ interest and contain lots of details about your items. Quality on-page content can help improve the ranking of your product pages and reduce overall thin content on your store. That’s why, in higher-ranking search results, you’ll typically see product pages with longer descriptions, reviews, and more. Try to include relevant keywords and subheadings in every section of your page to help Google understand what your content refers to. If you can’t create content for every product, focus on those currently ranking on the bottom of the first page. Boosting these results can have the biggest impact on conversions, as they don’t have as far to climb up in rankings. The more you write, the more accurate Google can be in ranking your page. Your customers won’t hate the extra product info either—it might even help persuade them to buy. Take advantage of related keywords Related keywords are exactly what they seem: They’re similar to your main keyword. Enter your keyword into Google Keyword Planner to find related terms and phrases that you can pursue with your content. You can also find related keywords through an Amazon search. Look up your main keyword and check for secondary keywords that repeatedly appear. For example, let’s say you’re trying to sell a blender. The terms “14 Speed,” “450W,” and “48oz Glass Jar” all appear multiple times, indicating they’re strong selling factors and likely common elements of search terms. If you’re getting traffic from a main keyword, try to slide onto the first page for related secondary keywords as well. Use related keywords in your content whenever they make sense. Create internal links The longer you can keep your visitors browsing your content, the more chance you have of making a sale. Relevant internal links to other pages on your site help potential customers browse and discover information or products. In your anchor text (the words that you place the internal link in), make sure you include the target keyword verbatim. Internal linking can be used to drive customers to relevant product pages, category pages, and educational content. Don’t get too wild with internal linking. One or two links every few hundred words is enough. 💡 Pro tip: If you understand your audience’s decision-making process, you can develop content that helps them through the various stages in their buying journey . 3. Site architecture for ecommerce When it comes to SEO ecommerce, how the pages on your site are organized and structured affects your search engine rankings. Site structure also impacts your user experience (UX). You need to make it easy for visitors and search engines bots to navigate content in your store. As you add and remove products and categories, site structure can get complicated. Before you progress too far with developing your website, ensure: You link to your most important collections from the main navigation menu. Any remaining collections are linked from non-navigation links on collections, products, and/or blog posts. All products are linked from a parent collection (this usually happens automatically). Your site structure is simple and easy to scale as your store grows. Every page of your site is reachable from the main structure within a few, intuitive clicks. Simplicity is underrated. You don’t want to have visitors relying on the back button to get around your site, running in circles trying to find what they’re looking for. You also don’t want to have to reorganize and rearrange your site structure every time you add a new product category. Most of your SEO link authority is on your homepage, because that’s the most common page other businesses link to when referring to your website. So, the more clicks away from your homepage a product page is, the less authority it has. Page indexing As you implement SEO on your website, you’ll want to make strategic choices about which webpages you choose to index and rank. Index is another name for the database used by a search engine. So to index a page is to have it added to that database. In other words, Google has discovered your page and added it to its search results: For advice on page indexing, take a look at these tips from Aleyda Solis, founder of SEO consultancy Orainti : Aleyda recommends identifying which page types are worth indexing and optimizing. Those pages should fulfill a real audience demand. “One of the most common issues for ecommerce sites is thin content, as well as content duplication,” Aleyda says. “Thin content is the idea that there’s not much actual text on an ecommerce site compared to, say, a blog or software site. Content duplication occurs when the same content appears on multiple product and category pages. “Adding blog content to your online store’s website is a good way to help counter thin content.” The easiest way to handle content duplication is to hide a page from search engines , known as noindex-ing. However, you can also create useful content for those pages to make them different, relevant, and competitive. You can also canonicalize pages. Canonicalizing a page is a way of telling Google that a URL is the “master version” you’d like to display in search results. This is helpful in duplicate content situations, because without canonical tags, Google might: Miss unique content while wading through duplicate content. Dilute your ranking ability. Choose the wrong master version for you. 💡 Good to know: If you’re using Shopify, auto-generated canonical tags are added to pages to prevent duplicate content from appearing in search results. Aleyda suggests going beyond noindex or canonicalization when you’re ready. “Assess if there are enough search queries around a product’s characteristics to identify whether to index its page,” she says. “If you do index a page, ask yourself if there’s enough content on the page and if it’s aligned with the way the users are searching. You may need to expand and optimize the page to keep it relevant and competitive.” Aleyda shared this handy chart to help visualize the indexing decision process: Page indexing flowchart by Aleyda. The big takeaway? Not every level of your site structure is worth indexing and optimizing, so be strategic and refer to the chart above. 💡 Pro tip: Add breadcrumbs to your product pages to improve website navigation for customers and Google. Breadcrumbs tell Google how your site is structured and let people know where they are within your store. Notice how Allbirds uses breadcrumbs on its product pages to orient users. If someone decides they don’t want to purchase the Everyday sneakers, they can easily click back to Men’s Shoes or the homepage and look for a different product. Use a third-party app like Category Breadcrumbs to show your customers the path they’ve navigated down through your category tree. 4. Technical SEO Technical SEO is an under-the-hood type of search engine optimization. It’s unseen by shoppers, but ensures your website is optimized for crawlers, has ideal site speed, and works on mobile. Strategic Technical SEO leads to: Better website engagement, because your site is fast and easy to access. More organic traffic because your site is easier to crawl. Some ways to improve your technical SEO for ecommerce include the following: Create logical internal navigation with your menus . Submit your sitemap to Google Search Console. Optimize images to load quickly. 💡 Hire a technical SEO expert to run a site audit and optimize your store from the Shopify Experts marketplace . 5. Google Merchant Center product feeds Ensure that your product feed is correctly verified in the Google Merchant Center so that your products appear in Google Shopping free listings and ads. This verification process confirms that your product data like titles, descriptions, prices, and availability is submitted accurately and meets Google's requirements. Here’s how to get your products listed in Google Shopping feeds : Verify that you own your website. This might happen automatically if you already use other Google tools like Google Analytics. Manual routes to verify include : email, our ecommerce platform, Google Tag Manager, or adding an HTML tag to your site's code. Once you’re verified, claim your website URL in Google Merchant Center to establish a connection between your site and your Merchant Center account. Submit product data. Upload your product information to Google Merchant Center using a supported format, such as a spreadsheet or XML file. Ensure that your data includes all required attributes and adheres to Google's product data specifications. Monitor feed status. Monitor your feed's status in your Google Merchant Center dashboard. Google will review your data for compliance with its policies. This review typically takes up to three business days . Address issues. If there are any errors or disapprovals, Google will provide details . Common problems include mismatched availability, incorrect pricing, or missing identifiers. You’ll be able to find any issues you need to correct in the Needs attention tab . Correct these issues promptly to ensure your products are eligible to appear on Google. A verified and accurate feed ensures that your products are discoverable by potential customers, enhances your visibility in search results, and contributes to a seamless shopping experience. 6. Publish relevant informational content Next, consider publishing relevant informational content that supports purchasing decisions or otherwise speaks to shoppers in the market for what you sell. This could be help center articles that cover common customer pre-purchase questions, About Us content that shares what makes your brand unique, or blog posts that target specific keywords that align with your audience’s interests and needs. You’re using SEO to power an ongoing content strategy . When it comes to blogging, every post published has the potential to: Build your reputation as a credible source. Improve your site’s authority. Increase visibility in organic search. Imagine you were starting a company that sells running gear . You want to help potential customers understand your products, use them more effectively, and solve their running and fitness problems. If you want to get found in search engines like Google, blogging can help you get there. A well-written blog gives your store a steady stream of original content. The more people who discover your content, the more reliable you’ll become as a source of information. This, in turn, helps you rank higher. Ecommerce businesses often struggle with blogging because it takes time, effort, and resources to get it right. Randomly publishing blog posts each month won’t bring traffic to your website. However, there are many ecommerce businesses that do blogging well. For example, retailer Au Lit Fine Linens sells everything to help you get a good night’s sleep, including luxury sheets, pillows, bath linens, and more. The brand also has a blog, Between the Sheets , that regularly provides helpful articles about how readers can improve sleep quality. Au Lit Fine Linens The blog is SEO driven, meaning that its purpose is to rank in search engines. Posts often highlight a problem the reader is having, and offer Au Lit Fine Linens products as the solution—a fine balance between promotional and informational. When starting a blog for ecommerce SEO, focus on the following three elements: Research what keywords to rank for. Publish content that targets keywords people are likely to search for when solving problems or making a buying decision. Optimize blog posts for SEO. Make sure each blog targets a specific keyword for SEO. Present your products as a solution to the problem. Every post doesn’t have to be about your products. But don’t be afraid to include a CTA and link out to a product page or two when appropriate. 7. Link building One of the oldest components of the Google algorithm is PageRank. It’s a system that seeks to understand webpage quality by looking at how many links it receives from other websites. Google uses the number, quality, and relevancy of a page’s links to judge its trustworthiness. As a result, new websites with few links have less authority in the eyes of search engines. While time can fix this, building quality backlinks can help Google recognize your authority more quickly. Respected TLDs , like .com, .gov, and .edu, tend to provide the most authority when they give you a backlink. Links from large, well-ranking websites operating within your niche are particularly lucrative. One of the best ways to approach building links is to focus on partnerships. Determine what content you can create that will provide value to other websites. If you can make something that others want to use, they’ll usually cite your content with a link. Guest posts Guest posting can be a functional way to build backlinks, provided the content you create for other websites is relevant to their users. Run some ecommerce keyword research and analyze backlinks with Ahrefs to find sites in your niche that are receptive to guest posts. Ahrefs Press mentions Another way to build backlinks to your ecommerce store is through press mentions. Building a press list or hiring a PR firm can be expensive, so here is a simple growth hack anyone can do.

If you get an interview, make sure to ask for a backlink to your website.

Ecommerce SEO is the process of making changes to an online store to increase the visibility of its web pages and product listings in search engine results pages (SERPs). How do I get SEO results for ecommerce? Build collection pages to target all of the ways that customers describe your product set. Optimize your product titles and descriptions for relevant keywords. Create useful content about your products, industry, or niche. Request backlinks from relevant websites to build your website’s authority. Add new content on a regular schedule to show that your website is active. Update your existing content regularly to keep information fresh and accurate. Is SEO good for ecommerce? SEO is a powerful tool for ecommerce businesses. It helps to increase organic traffic to your site, which can lead to higher visibility, more potential customers, and ultimately, increased sales. Additionally, SEO is a cost-effective marketing strategy as it targets users who are already looking for your products online. What is the difference between SEO and ecommerce SEO? The same principles apply to SEO and ecommerce SEO. However, ecommerce SEO strategies are tailored for online stores. The main goal of ecommerce SEO is to increase the visibility of products in search engine results to drive sales, while traditional SEO focuses on improving website content visibility to capture readers and attention. Tasks specific to ecommerce SEO include optimizing product pages and listings. How much does it cost to do SEO? The cost of doing SEO varies depending on the size of your website and the scope of your SEO goals. However, many aspects of SEO can be done at no cost. Tasks like keyword research, on-page optimization, and content creation are all essentially free, besides the time you invest. If you choose to hire an SEO professional or agency, costs will differ based on their expertise, the size of your website, and the extent of services required. Most businesses budget $1,500–$5,000 per month for intensive outsourced SEO projects. Does Shopify do SEO for you? Shopify stores have SEO features to help you optimize your content. For example, you can create optimized product titles, descriptions, alt text, and URLs. You can also harness the power of Shopify Magic to AI-generate optimized descriptions of your products. Other SEO features include the ability to submit your sitemap to Google Search Console and create a blog for your online store. Adding a blog to a Shopify store can help it rank for relevant keywords that don’t compete with product pages. For example, a Shopify store selling birthday party supplies may rank for product-focused keywords such as “balloons,” “streamers,” and “gifts.” Adding some thoughtful blog posts to this website may enable it to appear in other queries from motivated users, such as “how to plan a birthday party.” Is SEO worth it on Shopify? It’s important to consider SEO for your Shopify store because it helps increase visibility in search engine result pages (SERPs). When you optimize a Shopify store for users (by creating pages that address queries and acquiring backlinks from relevant websites) it will rank higher in results. The more pages you do this for, the more pages start ranking. Getting website traffic from organic search results helps you attract customers and spend less on paid marketing.

He has a BBA in Industrial Management from the University of Texas at Austin.

Whether you’re looking to make money online full-time or you just want to supplement your income, you have a variety of options to choose from. This wikiHow will show you a few easy ways that can get you some money quickly. Steps Method 1 Method 1 of 4: Completing Tasks Online Download Article 1 Take surveys. You can earn $50 to $100 per month in cash and products by taking online surveys.  Find survey sites by searching for “paid survey sites” online.  Sign up for several survey sites to increase your chances of being selected for higher-paying surveys.  Register with an email address, and check your email often so you can respond quickly to survey offers. Most surveys pay from $1 to $3, and the surveys generally take up to 45 minutes to complete. You might also get paid in gift cards, free products or by being entered in a sweepstakes. Never pay to participate in surveys. Look for a privacy policy displayed prominently on the site so you know that they are not selling your personal information. 2 Test websites. Remote usability testing means getting paid to navigate a website for the first time and giving feedback to the website owner.  Most tests take approximately 15 minutes, and you can get paid up to $10 for each test.  A test involves performing a scenario on the client’s website and recording yourself doing it.  For example, you might be asked to go through the process of selecting and purchasing an item on a retailer’s website. You need a computer with a microphone, an updated web browser and a high speed internet connection. [1] X Research source Sites that pay you to test websites include User Testing , WhatUsersDo, UserLytics , UserFeel . 3 Tutor students. Many families prefer the flexibility of using an online tutor.  Depending on your background, you could be simply helping a child with homework or providing college-level support.  You need to have your own computer and high speed internet.  Experience required differs among companies.  Some require “strong experience,” while others require a specific educational background.  However, most companies do require a college degree. Some companies assign students to you, while others post your profile on their site and let customers select you. [2] X Research source You can make anywhere from $9 to $30 per hour based on your educational background and the subject you teach. Sites that hire elementary-level tutors include Tutor.com , Aim4a and Brainfuse . Kaplan hires SAT and ACT tutors. Advertisement Method 2 Method 2 of 4: Creating a Niche Website Download Article 1 Understand how a niche website works. A niche website focuses on very targeted, specific information.  The content must be specific, useful and interesting to your target audience.  Successful niche websites get anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 visitors per month.  You build content on a particular keyword, and you make passive income with Google AdSense or through affiliate links. 2 Find a profitable niche. Starting with your interests, write down as many niche ideas as you can.  Think about topics people might search online.  Ideas include passions (like surfing or body building), fears (like spiders or speaking in front of crowds) and problems (like getting out of debt).  Do keyword research to see if others are interested in the topic.  Find out if a domain name is available that matches the keyword 100 percent. Use a keyword research tool to perform keyword research. [3] X Research source 3 Set up the site. Choose a website building platform, such as WordPress, Joomla or Drupal.  Next, choose a domain name and web hosting for your site.  The domain name is your web address.  Web hosting is a service that connects your site to the internet.  Once you have your domain name and web hosting, go to the control panel of your hosting account and install your website platform.  Design your website by choosing and installing a theme. [4] X Research source Popular web hosting companies include Bluehost and WPEngine. 4 Create content. Create content that people will find valuable and that will help you rank higher in the search engines.  Keyword research can help you to find out what topics people are searching for.  Write content on these topics to improve your rank in the search engines. You cannot monetize without any visitors. Use a tool like Market Samurai to do keyword research. Put out advertisements to increase traffic to your site. Create a marketing campaign using social media outlets such as Facebook or Twitter. 5 Monetize your site. Choose from several different strategies to monetize your website.  You can have ads on your website and get paid when visitors click on them.  Also, you can promote products, either your own or someone else’s, and get paid when people purchase. With Google AdSense, you install some code on your site that allows ads to appear on it.  You get paid when visitors click on the ads. You can also sell advertising space on your website. Affiliate marketing means that you promote products for your niche.  A link or banner advertising the product is displayed on your site.  If visitors click on it and make a purchase, you receive a commission. Advertisement Method 3 Method 3 of 4: Writing Freelance Articles Download Article 1 Consider your expertise. If you take the time to reflect on your experiences, you will realize that you have more knowledge about which to write than you might think.  Begin by listing three assets that define you, such as your profession, a special hobby or a personality trait.  Next, list three things that inspire you, such as religion, education or charity.  Finally, list three of your dreams, such as getting married, traveling or spending more time with your children.  These three lists should give you many ideas of topics about which you can write. [5] X Research source 2 Learn the principles of effective writing. As a freelance writer, much of your work will likely be published on the internet.  The principles of writing for the web differ slightly than writing for print.  The content must still be high-quality and well-written, but the presentation must be adjusted for the way people read online material. [6] X Research source Because of the low resolution of online text, readers tend to scan rather than read everything from top to bottom.  Make your text easily scannable by breaking up text using descriptive headings and bullet points. [7] X Research source Get to the point by using the inverted pyramid style.  This means writing the conclusion first and then providing examples to support it. [8] X Research source Make your copy effective by being concise and using simple language.  Aim your writing to an eighth-grade reading level.  Remove unnecessary or confusing words or terms. [9] X Research source Include keywords and phrases that improve your ranking in the search engines. [10] X Research source 3 Find work. When you first start out, you may have to accept work writing about a topic you don’t find all that interesting.  You must keep an open mind and be willing to accept work that may not be in your desired field.  However, as you continue to write, you not only learn about more topics, but you also build your reputation.  With time, you can be choosier about assignments you want to accept. Browse the internet for freelancing websites that hire contractors to do work online. 4 Get samples. When you first start out as a freelance writer, it can be hard to get work without any published samples.  However, it is possible to get quality samples if you are willing to do some writing for free.  First, you can publish content on your own blog or website.  Also, you can write guest posts for someone else’s blog.  Finally, you can write blog posts for free in exchange for a byline. 5 Write pitches. If you have located a client for whom you want to write, send pitches, which are topic ideas for articles.  Write pitches that not only show your expertise but also demonstrate your enthusiasm for the topic.  First, read the publication to which you are sending pitches to familiarize yourself with what they publish.  If applicable, identify a specific section and send our pitch to the appropriate editor.  Also, include a brief summary of who you are. [11] X Research source 6 Create a writer website or blog. A website not only demonstrates your technical ability, but it also creates an online hub that allows clients to connect to you. Keep the design of your website clean and uncluttered.  Include examples of your work that demonstrate the kind of writing you do.  Make the samples easy to find and to read, and make it easy for visitors to figure out how to contact you. [12] X Research source . A blog highlights your technical ability and showcases your ability to write blog posts. Your blog can be about different topics than those you write about for your clients. In fact, it should be on a topic that interests you.  Visitors will see that you can not only write, but you can also build an online community. A good blog has the potential to earn you many referrals for more clients. Advertisement Method 4 Method 4 of 4: Selling Your Stuff Online Download Article 1 Find items to sell. Purge your house.  Set aside a few days or a weekend to clean out and declutter your house.  Identify items to throw away, donate and sell.  Categorize the items you want to sell.  Different categories of items do better on different sites. [13] X Research source You can also go out and buy items for selling online at a mark-up. Books, CD’s and DVD’s sell well on Amazon. Collectibles, high-end clothing, and small electronics sell well on eBay. Craigslist is best for generic items such as tools or toys. 2 Open sellers accounts. Create accounts on Amazon, eBay, and Craigslist.  These platforms make it simple for sellers to set up accounts.  You generally need to provide some personal information such as your name and address, and you may need to provide financial information for processing payments. [14] X Research source Amazon sellers connect their checking accounts, and proceeds from sales are directly deposited into their checking accounts. eBay will either send your payments directly to your checking account or will deposit them in your PayPal account. 3 Learn then selling guidelines. Each marketplace has guidelines that define what you can and cannot sell.  State and federal laws also impact what items are prohibited.  In general, you cannot sell alcohol, weapons, service contracts, animals or event tickets.  Also, while not always prohibited, you may find restrictions on how you can sell items in some categories, such as art, gift cards and coupons. [15] X Research source eBay , Craigslist and Amazon publish these guidelines on their websites. 4 Research selling prices of items similar to yours. Look up completed sales or current listings of items similar to yours.  Find the high- and low-end prices, and price your object around the median price level.  If you want your item to sell quickly, price it at the low end.  The condition of the item also affects the price.  Items in poorer condition should be priced at the lower end.  Also, consider how many listings there already are of items similar to yours.  If many similar items will be competing with yours, you may have to set the price lower to get the sale. [16] X Research source 5 Consider selling in lots. A lot is a collection of similar items that is sold in a group.  For example, if you have a collection of books, magazines or similar pieces of jewelry, consider selling them all at once in a lot.  You many not make as much money as you would have if you sold each item separately.  However, the items will likely sell more quickly in a lot than they would individually. [17] X Research source 6 Write a thorough description. Including more details increases the likelihood of making a sale.  Since the buyer can’t see the object in person before purchasing, give them as much information as possible so they feel like they know what they’re buying, If an item is used, be truthful and upfront about its condition. [18] X Research source Proofread your description before publishing it. Write a descriptive title that provides information about the product, such as size, color or design. 7 Add high-quality pictures of the item. Use several images that show the item from different angles.  Remove all clutter from the background because it detracts attention from the item you’re selling.  Use natural lighting instead of a flash.  Take close-ups so people can see all the details of the item. [19] X Research source 8 Provide excellent customer service. Answer any questions buyers post as quickly as possible.  Be professional and courteous. Positive communication builds your reputation with buyers and gets you to return business.  Also, package your product well and ship it out quickly.  Allowing an item to become damaged or taking too long to ship can negatively affect your reputation among buyers.  Wrap all items, especially fragile ones, in appropriate packaging.  Commit to shipping items as soon as you receive payment. [20] X Research source Advertisement Join the Discussion... How can I make money online from home? WikiCaribouJammer153 Hello, wikiHow. I’m currently trying to move out of my parents’ home but I’m just not making enough money at my normal day job to do that in any realistic time. I’d love to speed the process up by picking up a side hustle, but here’s the problem. My day job is at a restaurant and it’s usually pretty busy. I’m so exhausted by the time that I get home that the idea of going out to do a second job just sounds impossible. I just wouldn’t be able to do it. I was thinking I’d pursue something online, but I don’t really know what the most realistic or viable? What can I do to make money from home? I’m pretty good on a computer, but I just can’t tell what’s legit or not when I search for jobs. Read More WikiSealHugger953 I was in your shoes a few years ago. I’ll tell you what I did. So, I started out doing transcription work online. I would be given an audio file and need to type out what I heard. It was very easy work, but I’m a little bit of a slow typer and it was really boring to me so I looked for something else. Still, if you’re a fast typist and you don’t mind listening to potentially dull audio files it’s very easy work. Then, I tried driving for Uber and Lyft. I figured sitting behind the wheel of a car wouldn’t be that exhausting. I was mostly right, but I really wanted to find something I could do from bed, honestly. But yeah, if you have a car, rideshare is a pretty easy way to make dough. I ended up eventually tutoring online. I worked with an agency who set me up with 3-4 students who needed help with math. I didn’t even have a math degree, I studied chemistry. But if you are good with working with younger people, that’s the route I’d go. It’s not crazy complicated and the money is pretty good! Read More Taras Rogers You're in a tough spot, and it’s completely understandable to feel stuck and exhausted. The good news is that with your computer skills and desire to work from home, there are realistic options that don't require a second physical job. Here are a few ideas to consider: Freelancing – Platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer have legit gigs in writing, data entry, graphic design, and virtual assistance. Start small, build a profile, and grow with time. Online Tutoring – If you're good at a subject, sites like Preply or Cambly pay for tutoring or casual conversation practice. Microtasks – Websites like Clickworker, Amazon MTurk, or Appen pay for small online tasks that you can do at your own pace. Selling Digital Services – If you can learn basic skills like Canva design, resume writing, or social media posting, you can offer those as services online.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] SEO targets unpaid search traffic (usually referred to as "" organic "" results) rather than direct traffic, referral traffic, social media traffic, or paid traffic . Organic search engine traffic originates from a variety of searches, including image search , video search , academic search , [ 3 ] news search, industry-specific vertical search engines, and large language models. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the algorithms that dictate search engine results, what people search for, the actual search queries or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by a target audience. SEO helps websites attract more visitors from a search engine and rank higher within a search engine results page (SERP), aiming to either convert the visitors or build brand awareness. [ 4 ] History Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web . Search engine users would query the URL of a page, and then receive information found on the page, if it existed in the search engine's index . ALIWEB and the earliest versions of search engines required website developers to manually upload website index files in order to be searchable and widely did not utilize any form of ranking algorithm for user queries. [ 5 ] The emergence of automated web crawlers would later be used to proactively discover and index websites. This led to website developers to optimize their website’s search signals, including the use of meta tags , to achieve greater visibility in search results. According to a 2004 article by former industry analyst and current Google employee Danny Sullivan , the phrase ""search engine optimization"" came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits SEO practitioner Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term. [ 6 ] In some cases, early search algorithms weighted particular HTML attributes in ways that could be leveraged by web content providers to manipulate their search rankings. [ 7 ] As early as 1997, search engine providers began adjusting their algorithms to prevent these actions. [ 8 ] Eventually, search engines would incorporate more meaningful measures of page purpose, including the more recent development of semantic search. [ 9 ] Some search engines frequently sponsor SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website. [ 12 ] Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the ""crawl rate"", and track the web pages index status. In 2015, it was reported that Google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products, resulting in brands and marketers shifting toward mobile-first experiences. [ 13 ] In the 2020s, the rise of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT , Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini gave rise to discussion around a concept variously referred to as generative engine optimization , answer engine optimization or artificial intelligence optimization . This approach focuses on optimizing content for inclusion in AI-generated answers provided by large language models (LLMs). This shift has led digital marketers to discuss content formats, authority signals, and how structured data is presented to make content more ""promptable"". [ 14 ] It has also been argued that each of these tactics should be considered as subsets of ""search experience optimization,"" described by Ahrefs as ""optimizing a brand’s presence for non-linear search journeys over multiple platforms, not just Google."" [ 15 ] Relationship between Google and SEO industry In 1998, two graduate students at Stanford University , Larry Page and Sergey Brin , developed ""Backrub"", a search engine that relied on a mathematical algorithm to rate the prominence of web pages. The number calculated by the algorithm, PageRank , is a function of the quantity and strength of inbound links . [ 16 ] PageRank estimates the likelihood that a given page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web and follows links from one page to another. In effect, this means that some links are stronger than others, as a higher PageRank page is more likely to be reached by the random web surfer. Page and Brin founded Google in 1998. [ 17 ] Google attracted a loyal following among the growing number of Internet users, who liked its simple design. [ 18 ] Off-page factors (such as PageRank and hyperlink analysis) were considered as well as on-page factors (such as keyword frequency, meta tags , headings, links and site structure) to enable Google to avoid the kind of manipulation seen in search engines that only considered on-page factors for their rankings. Although PageRank was more difficult to game , webmasters had already developed link-building tools and schemes to influence the Inktomi search engine, and these methods proved similarly applicable to gaming PageRank. Many sites focus on exchanging, buying, and selling links, often on a massive scale. Some of these schemes involved the creation of thousands of sites for the sole purpose of link spamming . [ 19 ] By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. [ 20 ] The leading search engines, Google, Bing , and Yahoo , do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization and have shared their personal opinions. [ 21 ] Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines. [ 22 ] In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users. [ 23 ] In 2007, Google announced a campaign against paid links that transfer PageRank. [ 24 ] On June 15, 2009, Google disclosed that they had taken measures to mitigate the effects of PageRank sculpting by use of the nofollow attribute on links. Matt Cutts , a well-known software engineer at Google, announced that Google Bot would no longer treat any no follow links, in the same way, to prevent SEO service providers from using nofollow for PageRank sculpting. [ 25 ] As a result of this change, the usage of nofollow led to evaporation of PageRank. In order to avoid the above, SEO engineers developed alternative techniques that replace nofollowed tags with obfuscated JavaScript and thus permit PageRank sculpting. Additionally, several solutions have been suggested that include the usage of iframes , Flash , and JavaScript. [ 26 ] In December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results. [ 27 ] On June 8, 2010 a new web indexing system called Google Caffeine was announced. Designed to allow users to find news results, forum posts, and other content much sooner after publishing than before, Google Caffeine was a change to the way Google updated its index in order to make things show up quicker on Google than before. According to Carrie Grimes, the software engineer who announced Caffeine for Google, ""Caffeine provides 50 percent fresher results for web searches than our last index..."" [ 28 ] Google Instant , real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs, the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results. [ 29 ] Google has implemented numerous algorithm updates to improve search quality, including Panda (2011) for content quality, Penguin (2012) for link spam, Hummingbird (2013) for natural language processing, and BERT (2019) for query understanding. These updates reflect the ongoing evolution of search technology and Google's efforts to combat spam while improving user experience. On May 20, 2025, Google announced that AI Mode would be released to all US users. AI Mode uses what Google calls a ""query fan-out technique"" which breaks down the search query into multiple sub-topics which generates additional search queries for the user. [ 30 ] Methods Getting indexed A simple illustration of the Pagerank algorithm. Percentage shows the perceived importance. The leading search engines, such as Google, Bing, Brave Search and Yahoo!, use crawlers to find pages for their algorithmic search results. Pages that are linked from other search engine-indexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically. The Yahoo! Directory and DMOZ , two major directories which closed in 2014 and 2017 respectively, both required manual submission and human editorial review. [ 31 ] Google offers Google Search Console , for which an XML Sitemap feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found, especially pages that are not discoverable by automatically following links [ 32 ] in addition to their URL submission console. [ 33 ] Yahoo! formerly operated a paid submission service that guaranteed to crawl for a cost per click ; [ 34 ] however, this practice was discontinued in 2009. Search engine crawlers may look at a number of different factors when crawling a site. Not every page is indexed by search engines. The distance of pages from the root directory of a site may also be a factor in whether or not pages get crawled. [ 35 ] Mobile devices are used for the majority of Google searches. [ 36 ] In November 2016, Google announced a major change to the way they are crawling websites and started to make their index mobile-first, which means the mobile version of a given website becomes the starting point for what Google includes in their index. [ 37 ] In May 2019, Google updated the rendering engine of their crawler to be the latest version of Chromium (74 at the time of the announcement).  Google indicated that they would regularly update the Chromium rendering engine to the latest version. [ 38 ] In December 2019, Google began updating the User-Agent string of their crawler to reflect the latest Chrome version used by their rendering service.  The delay was to allow webmasters time to update their code that responded to particular bot User-Agent strings.  Google ran evaluations and felt confident the impact would be minor. [ 39 ] Preventing crawling Main article: Robots exclusion standard To avoid undesirable content in the search indexes, webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard robots.txt file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a meta tag specific to robots (usually <meta name=""robots"" content=""noindex""> ). When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the root directory is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish to crawl. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login-specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam. [ 40 ] In 2020, Google sunsetted the standard (and open-sourced their code) and now treats it as a hint rather than a directive. To adequately ensure that pages are not indexed, a page-level robot's meta tag should be included. [ 41 ] Increasing prominence A variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results. Cross linking between pages of the same website to provide more links to important pages may improve its visibility. Page design makes users trust a site and want to stay once they find it. When people bounce off a site, it counts against the site and affects its credibility. [ 42 ] Writing content that includes frequently searched keyword phrases so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic. Updating content so as to keep search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site. Adding relevant keywords to a web page's metadata, including the title tag and meta description , will tend to improve the relevancy of a site's search listings, thus increasing traffic. URL canonicalization of web pages accessible via multiple URLs, using the canonical link element [ 43 ] or via 301 redirects can help make sure links to different versions of the URL all count towards the page's link popularity score. These are known as incoming links, which point to the URL and can count towards the page link's popularity score, impacting the credibility of a website. [ 42 ] White hat versus black hat techniques This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( September 2025 ) Common white-hat methods of search engine optimization SEO techniques can be classified into two broad categories: techniques that search engine companies recommend (""white hat""), and those techniques of which search engines do not approve (""black hat""). Search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter, among them spamdexing . Industry commentators have classified these methods and the practitioners who employ them as either white hat SEO or black hat SEO. [ 44 ] White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing. [ 45 ] An SEO technique is considered a white hat if it conforms to the search engines' guidelines and involves no deception. As the search engine guidelines [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 46 ] are not written as a series of rules or commandments, this is an important distinction to note. White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. White hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that content easily accessible to the online algorithms, rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO has been compared to web development that promotes accessibility, [ 47 ] although the two are not identical. Black hat SEO attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines or involve deception. One black hat technique uses hidden text, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible div , or positioned off-screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as cloaking . Another category sometimes used is grey hat SEO . This is in between the black hat and white hat approaches, where the methods employed avoid the site being penalized but do not act in producing the best content for users. Grey hat SEO is entirely focused on improving search engine rankings. [ citation needed ] Search engines may penalize sites they discover using black or grey hat methods, either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines' algorithms or by a manual site review. One example was the February 2006 Google removal of both BMW Germany and Ricoh Germany for the use of deceptive practices. [ 48 ] Both companies subsequently apologized, fixed the offending pages, and were restored to Google's search engine results page. [ 49 ] Companies that employ black hat techniques or other spammy tactics can get their client websites banned from the search results. In 2005, the Wall Street Journal reported on a company, Traffic Power , which allegedly used high-risk techniques and failed to disclose those risks to its clients. [ 50 ] Wired magazine reported that the same company sued blogger and SEO Aaron Wall for writing about the ban. [ 51 ] Google's Matt Cutts later confirmed that Google had banned Traffic Power and some of its clients. [ 52 ] As marketing strategy SEO is one approach within digital marketing, alongside other strategies such as pay-per-click advertising and social media marketing. Search engine marketing (SEM) is the practice of designing, running, and optimizing search engine ad campaigns. Its difference from SEO is most simply depicted as the difference between paid and unpaid priority ranking in search results. SEM focuses on prominence more so than relevance; website developers should regard SEM with the utmost importance with consideration to visibility as most navigate to the primary listings of their search. [ 53 ] A successful Internet marketing campaign may also depend upon building high-quality web pages to engage and persuade internet users, setting up analytics programs to enable site owners to measure results, and improving a site's conversion rate . [ 54 ] [ 55 ] In November 2015, Google released a full 160-page version of its Search Quality Rating Guidelines to the public, [ 56 ] which revealed a shift in their focus towards ""usefulness"" and mobile local search . In recent years the mobile market has exploded, overtaking the use of desktops, as shown in by StatCounter in October 2016, where they analyzed 2.5 million websites and found that 51.3% of the pages were loaded by a mobile device. [ 57 ] Google has been one of the companies that are utilizing the popularity of mobile usage by encouraging websites to use their Google Search Console , the Mobile-Friendly Test, which allows companies to measure up their website to the search engine results and determine how user-friendly their websites are. The closer the keywords are together their ranking will improve based on key terms. [ 42 ] SEO may generate an adequate return on investment . However, search engines are not paid for organic search traffic, their algorithms change, and there are no guarantees of continued referrals. Due to this lack of guarantee and uncertainty, a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer major losses if the search engines stop sending visitors. [ 58 ] Search engines can change their algorithms, impacting a website's search engine ranking, possibly resulting in a serious loss of traffic. According to Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt , in 2010, Google made over 500 algorithm changes – almost 1.5 per day. [ 59 ] Industry analysts note that websites may face risks from algorithm changes that can significantly impact organic traffic. In addition to accessibility in terms of web crawlers (addressed above), user web accessibility has become increasingly important for SEO. International markets and SEO Optimization techniques are highly tuned to the dominant search engines in the target market. The search engines' market shares vary from market to market, as does competition. Google has maintained dominant market share in most regions, with varying percentages by market. [ 60 ] In markets outside the United States, Google's share is often larger, and data showed Google was the dominant search engine worldwide as of 2007. [ 61 ] As of 2006, Google had an 85–90% market share in Germany. [ 62 ] As of March 2024, Google still had a significant market share of 89.85% in Germany. [ 63 ] As of March 2024, Google's market share in the UK was 93.61%. [ 64 ] Successful search engine optimization (SEO) for international markets requires more than just translating web pages. It may also involve registering a domain name with a country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) or a relevant top-level domain (TLD) for the target market, choosing web hosting with a local IP address or server, and using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve website speed and performance globally.  It is also important to understand the local culture so that the content feels relevant to the audience. This includes conducting keyword research for each market, using hreflang tags to target the right languages, and building local backlinks. However, the core SEO principles—such as creating high-quality content, improving user experience, and building links—remain the same, regardless of language or region. [ 62 ] Regional search engines have a strong presence in specific markets: China: Baidu leads the market, controlling about 70 to 80% market share. [ 65 ] South Korea: Since the end of 2021, Naver , a domestic web portal, has gained prominence in the country. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Russia: Yandex is the leading search engine in Russia. As of December 2023, it accounted for at least 63.8% of the market share. [ 68 ] Multilingual SEO By the early 2000s, businesses recognized that the web and search engines could help them reach global audiences. As a result, the need for multilingual SEO emerged. [ 69 ] In the early years of international SEO development, simple translation was seen as sufficient. However, over time, it became clear that localization and transcreation—adapting content to local language, culture, and emotional resonance—were more effective than basic translation. [ 70 ] Legal precedents On October 17, 2002, SearchKing filed suit in the United States District Court , Western District of Oklahoma, against the search engine Google. SearchKing's claim was that Google's tactics to prevent spamdexing constituted a tortious interference with contractual relations.  On May 27, 2003, the court granted Google's motion to dismiss the complaint because SearchKing ""failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted."" [ 71 ] [ 72 ] In March 2006, KinderStart filed a lawsuit against Google over search engine rankings. KinderStart's website was removed from Google's index prior to the lawsuit, and the amount of traffic to the site dropped by 70%. On March 16, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ( San Jose Division) dismissed KinderStart's complaint without leave to amend and partially granted Google's motion for Rule 11 sanctions against KinderStart's attorney, requiring him to pay part of Google's legal expenses.

[ 1 ] The search term is called a keyword . [ 2 ] The results of the search are displayed in the search engine 's results pages (SERPS) such as those given by Google , Bing, Yahoo! and others. Other terms used to describe search engine optimization are internet marketing and search engine marketing. [ 3 ] Core Principles [ change | change source ] SEO is performed because a website will receive more visitors from a search engine when it ranks higher on the SERP. These visitors can then be converted into customers. The process is often broken down into several core areas. On-page SEO [ change | change source ] On-page SEO refers to the practice of optimizing elements on the website itself. This includes: [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Content Quality and Relevance: Creating useful, comprehensive content that answers a user's query and demonstrates expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T) [ 6 ] . Keyword Optimization: Researching and using relevant keywords in titles, headings, and body text so that search engines can understand the page's topic. HTML Elements: Optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, and header tags (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) to provide clear signals about the page's structure. Technical SEO [ change | change source ] Technical SEO refers to non-content elements of a site that affect its performance and crawlability. Key aspects include: Site Speed and Core Web Vitals: Ensuring web pages load quickly and provide a good user experience . Mobile-Friendliness: Making sure the website is easy to use on mobile devices. Crawlability and Indexing: Using tools like robots.txt and sitemaps to help search engine crawlers find and index the site's content. Off-page SEO [ change | change source ] Everything SEO-related that doesn't take place on a website is considered off-page SEO. Among other things, backlinks , social media, and local citations are all aspects of off-page SEO. Importance of SEO [ change | change source ] SEO is a crucial part of marketing campaigns run by businesses to reach customers online. Companies hire SEO agencies to do the work for them because of the expertise required. [ 7 ] ""White Hat,"" ""Gray Hat,"" and ""Black Hat"" SEO Techniques [ change | change source ] If an SEO method is approved by search engines to rank their website, it is called a "" white hat technique "". If the method is not approved, it is called a ""black hat technique"". Search engines penalize sites using black hat techniques by ranking them lower, or by not showing them on search results at all. [ 8 ] However, some techniques fall in between these two categories, known as "" gray hat techniques ."" These methods are not explicitly approved by search engines but are not strictly prohibited either. While they may offer short-term ranking benefits, they carry the risk of penalties if search engine guidelines change. Evolution: The Impact of Generative AI [ change | change source ] Since the early 2020s, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into search engines has created a fundamental shift, leading to the emergence of a complementary discipline to traditional SEO. This new field is sometimes referred to as Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) or Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). Its primary goal is not to win a click from a list of links, but to have a brand's information or data used and cited within an AI-generated answer [ 9 ] . This scenario referral to a zero-click result - the successful resolution of a web query when the user gets their desired result immediately This evolution impacts all core areas of optimization: Impact on On-page SEO: There is a greater emphasis on creating machine-readable content through structured data (like Schema.org markup). This helps AI models understand entities, facts, and relationships on a page, increasing the likelihood of being included in a synthesized answer. [ 10 ] Impact on Technical SEO: Crawlability now extends to AI-specific crawlers like GPTBot (OpenAI) and Google-Extended. Webmasters must ensure their content is accessible to these bots for training and data ingestion purposes. [ 11 ] Impact on Off-page SEO: The concept of authority is expanding. Beyond backlinks, search engines now evaluate expertise and authoritativeness through a wider range of signals, often described by the E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) framework. This is crucial for being seen as a credible source by AI systems. [ 12 ] As a result, modern SEO is becoming a hybrid discipline, requiring strategies for both traditional search rankings and visibility within generative AI answers.

This figure depicts how companies organize to create content in harmony. Content marketing is a form of marketing focused on creating, publishing, and distributing content for a targeted audience online. [ 1 ] It is often used in order to achieve the following business goals: attract attention and generate leads, expand their customer base, generate or increase online sales, increase brand awareness or credibility, and engage a community of online users. Content marketing attracts new customers by creating and sharing valuable free content as well as by helping companies create sustainable brand loyalty , providing valuable information to consumers, and creating a willingness to purchase products from the company in the future. [ 2 ] Content marketing starts with identifying the customer's needs. After that, the information can be presented in a variety of long form and short form formats, including news, video, white papers , e-books , infographics , email newsletters , case studies, podcasts , how-to guides, question and answer articles, photos, blogs , etc. [ 3 ] Examples of short form content include short blog posts and social media posts. [ 4 ] Content marketing requires continuous delivery of large amounts of content, preferably within a content marketing strategy. [ 5 ] History Traditional marketers have long used content to disseminate information about a brand and build its reputation . Taking advantage of technological advances in transportation and communication, business owners began applying content marketing techniques in the late 19th century. Content marketing aims to attract and retain audiences by consistently creating and sharing valuable, relevant, and free content. Year Author\Organization Action taken 1732 Benjamin Franklin Issuance of Poor Richard's Almanack to promote his printing business [ 6 ] 1888 Johnson & Johnson introduced a publication called ""Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment"" targeted to doctors who used bandages. They also released two publications that contained tips for the medical community. [ 7 ] 1895 John Deere launched the magazine The Furrow providing information to farmers on how to become more profitable. The magazine, considered the first custom publication , is still in circulation, reaching 1.5 million readers in 40 countries in 12 different languages. [ 8 ] 1900 Michelin Developed the Michelin Guide , offering drivers information on auto maintenance, accommodations, and other travel tips. 35,000 copies were distributed for free in this first edition. [ 9 ] 1904 Jell-O Jell-O salesmen went door-to-door, distributing their cookbooks for free. Touting the dessert as a versatile food, the company saw its sales rise to over $1 million by 1906 [ citation needed ] [ 10 ] During the golden age of TV, between the 1940s and 1950s, advertising took over the media. Companies focused on sales rather than connecting with the public. There were few ventures into content marketing and not many prominent campaigns. During the baby boom era, Kellogg's began selling sugary cereal to children. With this change in business model came sociable animal mascots, lively animated commercials and the back of the cereal box as a form of targeted content marketing. This represented a new approach to making a brand memorable with the audience. [ 11 ] In the 1990s, everything changed for marketers. The arrival of computers and the Internet made websites and blogs flourish, and corporations found content marketing opportunities through email. E-commerce adaptations and digital distribution became the foundation of marketing strategy. The Internet also helped content marketing become a mainstream form of marketing. Traditional media such as newspapers, magazines, radio and TV started to lose their power in the marketplace. Companies started to promote and sell their products digitally. [ 12 ] The phrase ""content marketing"" was used as early as 1996, [ 13 ] when John F. Oppedahl led a roundtable for journalists at the American Society for Newspaper Editors. In 1998, Jerrell Jimerson held the title of ""director of online and content marketing"" at Netscape. [ 14 ] In 1999, author Jeff Cannon wrote, ""In content marketing, content is created to provide consumers with the information they seek."" [ 15 ] By the late 2000s, when social networks such as Facebook , Twitter , and YouTube were born, online content marketing was accessible, shareable and on-demand anytime worldwide. By 2014, Forbes Magazine's website had written about the seven most popular ways companies use content marketing. [ 16 ] In it, the columnist points out that by 2013, the use of content marketing had jumped across corporations from 60% a year or so before, to 93% [ 17 ] as part of their overall marketing strategy. Despite the fact that 70% of organizations are creating more content, only 21% of marketers think they are successful at tracking return on investment . Today, content marketing has become a powerful model for marketers. Storytelling is part of it, and they must convey the companies' messages or goal to their desired audience without pushing them to just buy the product or service. Implications The rise of content marketing has turned many traditional businesses into media publishing companies. [ 18 ] For example: Red Bull , which sells a high-energy beverage, has published YouTube videos, hosted experiences, and sponsored events around extreme sports and activities like mountain biking, BMX, motocross, snowboarding, skateboarding, cliff-diving, freestyle motocross, and Formula 1 racing. Red Bull Media House is a unit of Red Bull that ""produces full-length feature films for cinema and downstream channels (DVD, VOD, TV)."" [ 19 ] The Red Bulletin is an international monthly magazine Red Bull publishes with a focus on men's sports, culture, and lifestyle. Personal finance site Mint.com used content marketing, specifically their personal finance blog MintLife, to build an audience for a product they planned to sell. According to entrepreneur Sachin Rekhi, Mint.com concentrated on building the audience for MintLife ""independent of the eventual Mint.com product."" [ 20 ] Content on the blog included how-to guides on paying for college, saving for a house, and getting out of debt. Other popular content included in-depth interviews and a series of financial disasters called ""Trainwreck Tuesdays."" The popularity of the site surged as did demand for the product. ""Mint grew quickly enough to sell to Intuit for $170 million after three years in business. By 2013, the tool reached 10 million users, many of whom trusted Mint to handle their sensitive banking information because of the blog's smart, helpful content."" [ 21 ] The rise of content marketing has also accelerated the growth of online platforms, such as YouTube , Yelp , LinkedIn , Tumblr , Pinterest , and more. For example: YouTube, a subsidiary of Google, is an online video platform driving (and benefiting from) the surge to content marketing. [ 22 ] As of 2016, YouTube had over 1 billion users, representing 1/3 of all internet users and reaching more people 18–34 years of age than any cable provider in the U.S. [ 23 ] Yelp, an online business directory, has seen 30% year over growth in the number of reviews, ending the second quarter of 2016 with 108 million reviews for over 3 million businesses. [ 24 ] Businesses actively curate their content on these platforms with hopes to expand their reach to new audiences. Part of transitioning to a media publishing mindset requires a change in structure and process to create content at ""the speed of culture."" Marketing content production is transforming from an advertising agency model to a newsroom model, according to one consultant. [ 25 ] Common metrics Metrics to determine the success of content marketing are often tied to the original goals of the campaign. For example, for each of these goals, a content marketer may measure the different engagement and conversion metrics: Brand awareness and visibility Businesses focused on expanding their reach to more customers will want to pay attention to the increase in the volume of visitors, as well as the quality of those interactions. Traditional measures of volume include the number of visitors to a page and number of emails collected, while time spent on page and click-through to other pages/ photos are good indicators for engagement. [ citation needed ] Number of visitors to a page Time spent on the page Click-through across pages/ photos Number of emails collected Brand health metrics Businesses want to measure the impact that their messages have on consumers. Brand health refers to the positive or negative feedback that a company gets. It also measures how important a brand is for consumers. With this companies want to find out if brand reputation influences their customers to make a purchase. [ 26 ] Measures in this part comprise Share of voice (SOV) is the number of times a brand has been talked versus its competitors (conversations). Outside the digital world, SOV stands for the space and frequency a brand advertisement is placed on traditional media. Sentiment is when the brand has positive, negative or neutral feedback. Brand Influence refers to the number of times a post, comment or tweet is shared on different platforms. [ 27 ] Diversified user base For businesses hoping to reach not only more - but also new - types of customers online, they should pay attention to the demographics of new visitors, as evidenced by cookies that can be installed, different sources of traffic, different online behaviors, and/or different buying habits of online visitors. Demographics of visitors (i.e., age, gender, location, income, interests, device preference, etc.) Sources of traffic (i.e., SEO, social media, referral, direct) Differences in buying patterns and user-behavior of visitors Sales Businesses focused on increasing sales through content marketing should look at traditional e-commerce metrics including click-through-rate from a product-page to check-out and completion rates at the check-out. Altogether, these form a conversion funnel. Moreover, to better understand customers' buying habits, they should look at other engagement metrics like time spent per page, number of product-page visits per user, and re-engagement. Conversion through the sales process (the process from sign-up to check-out), including click-through-rates at each stage of the conversion funnel Time spent on the page Re-engagement (i.e., percentage of returning visitors) Click-through across product pages Innovation metrics Refers to companies that want to analyze whether their social media campaigns are generating commentary among consumers. This helps them to come up with ways to improve their product and service. This involves ""high level of brand engagement and builds brand loyalty"". [ 28 ] Examples: When a company makes a post through their social media platforms and shares their ideas, consumers can be influenced or motivated to share their opinions. Trend spotting refers to the latest consumers' comments about a brand, product or service that must be targeted. Some tools can be provided by Google Trends, Trendsmap (Twitter) and other sites that report what is in everybody's mouths worldwide. Digital use Digital content marketing Digital content marketing, which is a management process, uses digital products through different electronic channels to identify, forecast and satisfy the necessity of the customers. [ 29 ] Examples: On March 6, 2012, Dollar Shave Club launched their online video campaign. In the first 48 hours of their video debuting on YouTube they had over 12,000 people signing up for the service. The video cost just $4500 to make and as of November 2015 has had more than 21 million views. The video was considered one of the best viral marketing campaigns of 2012 and won ""Best Out-of-Nowhere Video Campaign"" at the 2012 AdAge Viral Video Awards. The Big Word Project , launched in 2008, aimed to redefine the Oxford English Dictionary by allowing people to submit their website as the definition of their chosen word.  The project, created to fund two Masters students' educations, attracted the attention of bloggers worldwide, and was featured on Daring Fireball and Wired Magazine . [ 30 ] In mid 2016, an Indian tea company (TE-A-ME) has delivered 6,000 tea bags [ 31 ] to Donald Trump and launched a video content on YouTube and Facebook. The video campaign received various awards including most creative PR stunt [ 32 ] in Southeast Asia after receiving 52000+ video shares, 3.1M video view in first 72-hour and hundreds of publication mentions (including Mashable , Quartz , [ 33 ] Indian Express , [ 34 ] Buzzfeed [ 35 ] ) across 80+ countries. Spotify started its viral marketing campaign Spotify Wrapped in 2016. [ 36 ] The campaign was designed to promote Spotify by encouraging people to share their music taste on social media. The release of Spotify Wrapped in early December each year has historically correlated with a boost to Spotify's app store ranking. [ 36 ] In December 2019, more than 1,200,000 posts on Twitter were about Spotify Wrapped after it came out near the beginning of the month. [ 37 ] Way of digital content marketing Combination of the supply chain and the users' experience The supply chain of digital content marketing mainly consists of commercial stakeholders and end-user stakeholders which represent content providers and distributors and customers separately. [ 38 ] In this process, distributors manage the interface between the publisher and the consumer, then distributors could identify the content that consumers need through external channels and implement marketing strategies. For instance, Library and document supply agencies as intermediaries can deliver the digital content of e-books, and e-journal articles to the users according to their search results through the electronic channels. Another example is when consumers pay for the acquisition of some MP3 downloads, search engines can be used to identify different music providers and smart agents can be used by consumers to search for multiple music provider sites. In a word, the digital content marketing process needs to be conducted at the business level and service experience level because when consumers are accessing digital content, their own experience depends on the complex network of relationships in the content marketing channels such as websites and videos. The consumers interact directly with distributors in the big supply chain through various digital products which have an important role in meeting the requirements of the consumers. The design and user experience of these channels directly decides the success of digital content marketing. [ 29 ] Interaction with the consumer through electronic service Electronic services refer to interactive network services. [ 39 ] In the electronic service, the interaction between the customer and the organizations mainly through the network technology, such as using E-mail, telephone, online chat windows for communication. Electronic services are different from traditional services and they are not affected by distance restrictions and opening hours. Digital content marketing through electronic service is usually served together with other channels to achieve marketing purposes including face-to-face, postal, and other remote services. Information companies provide different messages and documents to customers who use multiple search engines on different sites and set up access rights for business groups. These are some channels of digital content marketing.

It is a type of marketing that helps businesses by giving people helpful content instead of just trying to sell things directly. Companies use this type of marketing to build trust and show they are experts in their field. [ 1 ] Differences from traditional marketing [ change | change source ] Content Marketing is different from traditional advertising. Traditional advertising tries to sell products directly through ads, commercials, and sales messages. Content marketing focuses on helping people by giving them useful information , entertainment , or education . Instead of saying ""buy our product,"" content marketing says ""here is some helpful tips to solve your pain point or achieve your goal."" [ 2 ] Types of content marketing [ change | change source ] Blog posts and articles Videos and tutorials Podcasts Social media posts Email newsletters E-books and guides Webinars Case studies Online communities How it works [ change | change source ] Content marketing works by attracting people who are interested in a topic related to a business. For example, a cooking company might write blog posts about healthy recipes. People who read these posts might later buy the company's cooking products. The company builds trust by being helpful first, then customers are more likely to buy from them. [ 3 ] Benefits [ change | change source ] Content marketing helps businesses in many ways: Builds trust with customers Shows the company knows about their industry Brings more visitors to websites Costs less than traditional advertising Helps with search engine rankings Creates long-term relationships with customers References [ change | change source ] ↑ ""What Is Content Marketing?"" . contentmarketinginstitute.com .

[ 1 ] Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks , a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance. [ 2 ] ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing , computer vision , speech recognition , email filtering , agriculture , and medicine . The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics . Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework. History [ edit ] See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. [ 10 ] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior , in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells . [ 11 ] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. [ 10 ] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch , who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes. [ 10 ] By the early 1960s, an experimental ""learning machine"" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyse sonar signals, electrocardiograms , and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . It was repetitively ""trained"" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a "" goof "" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. [ 12 ] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nils Nilsson 's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. [ 13 ] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. [ 14 ] In 1981, a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. [ 15 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P ,  improves with experience E ."" [ 16 ] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper "" Computing Machinery and Intelligence "", in which the question, ""Can machines think?"", is replaced with the question, ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"". [ 17 ] Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. [ 18 ] Current Supervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of classification and regression. Current Unsupervised Learning Algorithms have objectives of clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule. Current Reinforcement Learning Algorithms focus on decisions that must be made with respect to some previous, unknown time and are broken down to either be studies of model based methods, and model free methods. In 2014 Ian Goodfellow and others introduced generative adversarial networks (GANs) with realistic data synthesis. [ 19 ] By 2016 AlphaGo obtained victory against top human players using reinforcement learning techniques. [ 20 ] Shortly after, transformer architectures obtained natural language processing, powering the now popular large language models advancing generative AI and multimodal applications. [ 21 ] Relationships to other fields [ edit ] Artificial intelligence [ edit ] Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence . [ 22 ] As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI as an academic discipline , some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed "" neural networks ""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalised linear models of statistics. [ 23 ] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis . [ 24 ] : 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. [ 24 ] : 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour. [ 25 ] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming (ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval . [ 24 ] : 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as "" connectionism "", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield , David Rumelhart , and Geoffrey Hinton . Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation . [ 24 ] : 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence, to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic , and probability theory . [ 25 ] Data compression [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Data compression § Machine learning . [ edit ] There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for ""general intelligence"". [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors , and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM. [ 29 ] According to AIXI theory, a connection more directly explained in Hutter Prize , the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software include NVIDIA Maxine , AIVC. [ 30 ] Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression include OpenCV , TensorFlow , MATLAB 's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression. [ 31 ] In unsupervised machine learning , k-means clustering can be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such as image compression . [ 32 ] Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by the centroid of its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial in image and signal processing , k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space. [ 33 ] Large language models (LLMs) are also efficient lossless data compressors on some data sets, as demonstrated by DeepMind 's research with the Chinchilla 70B model. Developed by DeepMind, Chinchilla 70B effectively compressed data, outperforming conventional methods such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for images and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) for audio. It achieved compression of image and audio data to 43.4% and 16.4% of their original sizes, respectively. There is, however, some reason to be concerned that the data set used for testing overlaps the LLM training data set, making it possible that the Chinchilla 70B model is only an efficient compression tool on data it has already been trained on. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as "" unsupervised learning "" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. [ citation needed ] Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimisation : Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples). [ 36 ] Generalization [ edit ] Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns. [ 37 ] Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be. [ 38 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, [ 39 ] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning . [ 40 ] Statistical physics [ edit ] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space of deep neural networks . [ 41 ] Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics . [ 42 ] Theory [ edit ] Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience. [ 3 ] [ 43 ] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalisation error . For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalisation will be poorer. [ 44 ] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches [ edit ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to the learning system: Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a ""teacher"", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ). Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. [ 3 ] Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary . Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. [ 48 ] The data, known as training data , consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector , and the training data is represented by a matrix . Through iterative optimisation of an objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. [ 49 ] An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. [ 16 ] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning , classification and regression . [ 50 ] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data. [ 51 ] Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Unsupervised learning See also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction , [ 5 ] and density estimation . [ 52 ] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation , the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labelled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning , the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. [ 55 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article: Reinforcement learning In reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in an environment: these produce a reward and/or a representation of the state, which is fed back to the agent. Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimisation , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithms . In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. [ 56 ] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Dimensionality reduction [ edit ] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. [ 57 ] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the ""number of features"". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction . One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D).
The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds , and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularisation . Other types [ edit ] Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, topic modelling , meta-learning . [ 58 ] Self-learning [ edit ] Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA). [ 59 ] [ 60 ] It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. [ 61 ] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive a consequence situation s ' compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behaviour, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations. [ 62 ] Feature learning [ edit ] Main article: Feature learning Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. [ 63 ] Classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , and supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data.  Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorisation [ 64 ] and various forms of clustering . [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. [ 68 ] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. [ 69 ] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix . The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. [ 70 ] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k -SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. [ 71 ] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. [ 72 ] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud , a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers , novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. [ 73 ] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. [ 74 ] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. [ 75 ] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning [ edit ] Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, [ 76 ] [ 77 ] and finally meta-learning (e.g. MAML). Association rules [ edit ] Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"". [ 78 ] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. [ 79 ] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning, and artificial immune systems . Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. [ 80 ] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\displaystyle \{\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \}\Rightarrow \{\mathrm {burger} \}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements . In addition to market basket analysis , association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and bioinformatics . In contrast with sequence mining , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm , with a learning component, performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , or unsupervised learning . They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. [ 81 ] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs . Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing . Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. [ 85 ] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction , proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set. Models [ edit ] A machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, once ""trained"" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions. [ 86 ] By extension, the term ""model"" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned. [ 87 ] Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection . Artificial neural networks [ edit ] Main article: Artificial neural network See also: Deep learning An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain . Here, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains . Such systems ""learn"" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called "" artificial neurons "", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number , and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology . Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision , speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis . Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition. [ 88 ] Decision trees [ edit ] Main article: Decision tree learning A decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the Titanic Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers ) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making . In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making. Random forest regression [ edit ] Random forest regression (RFR) falls under umbrella of decision tree-based models . RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting. To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling, for instance each decision tree is trained on random data from the training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve a higher degree of accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single output data as well multiple regressor tasks. This makes RFR compatible to be used in various applications. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] Support-vector machines [ edit ] Main article: Support-vector machine Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category. [ 91 ] An SVM training algorithm is a non- probabilistic , binary , linear classifier , although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick , implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Regression analysis [ edit ] Main article: Regression analysis Illustration of linear regression on a data set Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression , where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares . The latter is often extended by regularisation methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression . When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel [ 92 ] ), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification ) or even kernel regression , which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space. Multivariate linear regression extends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting a multidimensional linear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images, [ 93 ] which are inherently multi-dimensional. Bayesian networks [ edit ] Main article: Bayesian network A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences , are called dynamic Bayesian networks . Generalisations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams . Gaussian processes [ edit ] Main article: Gaussian processes An example of Gaussian Process Regression (prediction) compared with other regression models [ 94 ] A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution , and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function , or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations. Given a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point. Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimisation used to do hyperparameter optimisation . Genetic algorithms [ edit ] Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection , using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms . [ 97 ] Belief functions [ edit ] Main article: Dempster–Shafer theory The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability , possibility and imprecise probability theories . These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g.,  Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a pmf -based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities. [ 98 ] However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification . These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary , low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving. [ 99 ] [ 7 ] However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches. Rule-based models [ edit ] Main article: Rule-based machine learning Rule-based machine learning (RBML) is a branch of machine learning that automatically discovers and learns 'rules' from data. It provides interpretable models, making it useful for decision-making in fields like healthcare, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Key RBML techniques includes learning classifier systems , [ 100 ] association rule learning , [ 101 ] artificial immune systems , [ 102 ] and other similar models. These methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time. Training models [ edit ] Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text , a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams. Federated learning [ edit ] Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralises the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. This also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google . [ 103 ] Applications [ edit ] There are many applications for machine learning, including: Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive website Affective computing Astronomy Automated decision-making Banking Behaviorism Bioinformatics Brain–machine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen Science Climate Science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial data analysis [ 104 ] General game playing Handwriting recognition Healthcare Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Investment management [ 105 ] Knowledge graph embedding Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Material Engineering Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimisation Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunications Theorem proving Time-series forecasting Tomographic reconstruction [ 106 ] User behaviour analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first "" Netflix Prize "" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs -Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million. [ 107 ] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realised that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly. [ 108 ] In 2010, an article in The Wall Street Journal noted the use of machine learning by Rebellion Research to predict the 2008 financial crisis . [ 109 ] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems , Vinod Khosla , predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. [ 110 ] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists. [ 111 ] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning. [ 112 ] In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19. [ 113 ] Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behaviour of travellers. [ 114 ] Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone. [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting . By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS . [ 118 ] Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes. [ 119 ] Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] Limitations [ edit ] Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] [ 127 ] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems. [ 128 ] The "" black box theory "" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data. [ 129 ] The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an ""intelligence system"" that could have a ""substantial impact on an individual's life"" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided ""a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions"" it makes. [ 129 ] In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision. [ 130 ] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] Microsoft's Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users. [ 133 ] Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves. [ 134 ] Explainability [ edit ] Main article: Explainable artificial intelligence Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. [ 135 ] It contrasts with the ""black box"" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. [ 136 ] By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. Overfitting [ edit ] Main article: Overfitting The blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is. [ 137 ] Other limitations and vulnerabilities [ edit ] Learners can also disappoint by ""learning the wrong lesson"". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses. [ 138 ] A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgements from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in ""adversarial"" images that the system misclassifies. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel. [ 141 ] Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion via adversarial machine learning . [ 142 ] Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories ""spam"" and well-visible ""not spam"" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access . [ 143 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Model assessments [ edit ] Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold- cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap , which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy. [ 146 ] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model. [ 147 ] Ethics [ edit ] This section is an excerpt from Ethics of artificial intelligence . [ edit ] The ethics of artificial intelligence covers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes. [ 148 ] This includes algorithmic biases , fairness , [ 149 ] automated decision-making , [ 150 ] accountability , privacy , and regulation . It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such as machine ethics (how to make machines that behave ethically), lethal autonomous weapon systems , arms race dynamics, AI safety and alignment , technological unemployment , AI-enabled misinformation , [ 151 ] how to treat certain AI systems if they have a moral status (AI welfare and rights), artificial superintelligence and existential risks . [ 148 ] Some application areas may also have particularly important ethical implications, like healthcare , education, criminal justice, or the military. Bias [ edit ] Main article: Algorithmic bias Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society. [ 152 ] Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitising cultural prejudices. [ 153 ] For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names. [ 152 ] Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants. [ 154 ] [ 155 ] Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica 's predictive algorithm that resulted in ""disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities"" after being trained with historical crime data. [ 156 ] While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases. [ 157 ] In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, ""female faculty merely make up 16.1%"" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world. [ 158 ] Furthermore, among the group of ""new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates,"" 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI. [ 158 ] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases. [ 161 ] [ 162 ] In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay , a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language. [ 163 ] In an experiment carried out by ProPublica , an investigative journalism organisation, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged ""black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants"". [ 156 ] In 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognise gorillas. [ 164 ] Similar issues with recognising non-white people have been found in many other systems. [ 165 ] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains. [ 166 ] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li , who said that ""[t]here's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility."" [ 167 ] Financial incentives [ edit ] There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated. [ 168 ] Hardware [ edit ] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units. [ 169 ] By 2019, graphics processing units ( GPUs ), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI. [ 170 ] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months. [ 171 ] [ 172 ] Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) [ edit ] Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are specialised hardware accelerators developed by Google specifically for machine learning workloads. Unlike general-purpose GPUs and FPGAs , TPUs are optimised for tensor computations, making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference. They are widely used in Google Cloud AI services and large-scale machine learning models like Google's DeepMind AlphaFold and large language models. TPUs leverage matrix multiplication units and high-bandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency. [ 173 ] Since their introduction in 2016, TPUs have become a key component of AI infrastructure, especially in cloud-based environments. Neuromorphic computing [ edit ] Neuromorphic computing refers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. These systems may be implemented through software-based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures. [ 174 ] Physical neural networks [ edit ] A physical neural network is a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials, such as memristors, to emulate the function of neural synapses . The term ""physical neural network"" highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses. [ 175 ] [ 176 ] Embedded machine learning [ edit ] Embedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed on embedded systems with limited computing resources, such as wearable computers , edge devices and microcontrollers . [ 177 ] [ 178 ] [ 179 ] [ 180 ] Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets. Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques, such as hardware acceleration , [ 181 ] [ 182 ] approximate computing , [ 183 ] and model optimisation. [ 184 ] [ 185 ] Common optimisation techniques include pruning , quantisation , knowledge distillation , low-rank factorisation, network architecture search, and parameter sharing.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] It is a subfield of computer science . [ 3 ] The idea came from work in artificial intelligence . [ 4 ] Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms which can learn and make predictions on data . [ 5 ] Such algorithms follow programmed instructions , but can also make predictions or decisions based on data. [ 6 ] : 2 They build a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is done where designing and programming explicit algorithms cannot be done. Examples include spam filtering , detection of artificial neural network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach, [ 7 ] optical character recognition (OCR), [ 8 ] search engines and computer vision . Using machine learning has risks. Some algorithms create a final model which is a black box . [ 9 ] Models have been criticized for biases in hiring, [ 10 ] criminal justice, [ 11 ] and recognizing faces. [ 12 ] Overview [ change | change source ] Learning algorithms try to predict what will happen in the future with patterns from the past. These predictions can be obvious: for example, if the sun rose for the past 10,000 days, it will probably rise again. These predictions can also be more complex. An example of a complex prediction is facial recognition (knowing who someone is by looking at face). Machine learning programs can do things that it hasn't been told to do by a programmer . Machine learning programs will be shown some patterns. These patterns will be an input (such as a question) and an output (the answer to the question). Then, the machine learning program will predict the output based on the input. Machine learning isn't always necessary. Computers can do simple tasks by being told instructions. However, sometimes there are a lot of things that control the output. Then, it is hard for a human to tell the computer all of the instructions. It is sometimes easier to tell the computer how to teach itself. [ 13 ] There are a lot of different ways to tell the computer to teach itself. When a problem has a lot of answers, different answers can be marked as valid. This is used to form data that the computer is trained with. One example of training data is the MNIST data. The MNIST data has images of handwritten numbers. The computer can learn to identify handwritten numbers using the MNIST data.

It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search ); recommendation systems (used by YouTube , Amazon , and Netflix ); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant , Siri , and Alexa ); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo ); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art ); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go ). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: ""A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore ."" [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning , knowledge representation , planning , natural language processing , perception , and support for robotics . [ a ] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization , formal logic , artificial neural networks , and methods based on statistics , operations research , and economics . [ b ] AI also draws upon psychology , linguistics , philosophy , neuroscience , and other fields. [ 4 ] Some companies, such as OpenAI , Google DeepMind and Meta , [ 5 ] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, [ 6 ] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. [ 11 ] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture . [ 12 ] In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom . Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks , prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. Goals The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. [ a ] Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 13 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 14 ] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a ""combinatorial explosion"": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. [ 15 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. [ 16 ] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering [ 17 ] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, [ 18 ] scene interpretation, [ 19 ] clinical decision support, [ 20 ] knowledge discovery (mining ""interesting"" and actionable inferences from large databases ), [ 21 ] and other areas. [ 22 ] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. [ 23 ] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; [ 24 ] situations, events, states, and time; [ 25 ] causes and effects; [ 26 ] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); [ 27 ] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); [ 28 ] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); [ 29 ] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as ""facts"" or ""statements"" that they could express verbally). [ 16 ] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition , the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. [ c ] Planning and decision-making An ""agent"" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. [ d ] [ 32 ] In automated planning , the agent has a specific goal. [ 33 ] In automated decision-making , the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "" utility "") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "" expected utility "": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility. [ 34 ] In classical planning , the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. [ 35 ] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is ""unknown"" or ""unobservable"") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not ""deterministic""). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked. [ 36 ] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning ), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. [ 37 ] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. [ 38 ] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration ), be heuristic , or it can be learned. [ 39 ] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. [ 40 ] Learning Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. [ 41 ] It has been a part of AI from the beginning. [ e ] In supervised learning , the training data is labelled with the expected answers, while in unsupervised learning , the model identifies patterns or structures in unlabelled data. There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. [ 44 ] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input). [ 45 ] In reinforcement learning , the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as ""good"". [ 46 ] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. [ 47 ] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning. [ 48 ] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity , by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization . [ 49 ] Natural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages. [ 50 ] Specific problems include speech recognition , speech synthesis , machine translation , information extraction , information retrieval and question answering . [ 51 ] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky 's generative grammar and semantic networks , had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation [ f ] unless restricted to small domains called "" micro-worlds "" (due to the common sense knowledge problem [ 29 ] ). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), [ 52 ] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), [ 53 ] and others. [ 54 ] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or ""GPT"") language models began to generate coherent text, [ 55 ] [ 56 ] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam , SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. [ 57 ] Perception Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar , sonar, radar, and tactile sensors ) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input. [ 58 ] The field includes speech recognition , [ 59 ] image classification , [ 60 ] facial recognition , object recognition , [ 61 ] object tracking , [ 62 ] and robotic perception . [ 63 ] Social intelligence Kismet , a robot head which was made in the 1990s; it is a machine that can recognize and simulate emotions. [ 64 ] Affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood . [ 65 ] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction . However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. [ 66 ] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis , wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject. [ 67 ] General intelligence A machine with artificial general intelligence would be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence . [ 68 ] Techniques AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. [ b ] Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. [ 69 ] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search . State space search State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. [ 70 ] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis . [ 71 ] Simple exhaustive searches [ 72 ] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers . The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. [ 15 ] "" Heuristics "" or ""rules of thumb"" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal. [ 73 ] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position. [ 74 ] Local search Illustration of gradient descent for 3 different starting points; two parameters (represented by the plan coordinates) are adjusted in order to minimize the loss function (the height) Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally. [ 75 ] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function . Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks , [ 76 ] through the backpropagation algorithm. Another type of local search is evolutionary computation , which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by ""mutating"" and ""recombining"" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation. [ 77 ] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking ) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails ). [ 78 ] Logic Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation . [ 79 ] Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as ""and"", ""or"", ""not"" and ""implies"") [ 80 ] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as "" Every X is a Y "" and ""There are some X s that are Y s""). [ 81 ] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement ( conclusion ) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises ). [ 82 ] Proofs can be structured as proof trees , in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules . Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms . In the case of Horn clauses , problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. [ 83 ] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic , resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved. [ 84 ] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable , and therefore intractable . However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog , is Turing complete . Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages. [ 85 ] Fuzzy logic assigns a ""degree of truth"" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true. [ 86 ] Non-monotonic logics , including logic programming with negation as failure , are designed to handle default reasoning . [ 28 ] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning A simple Bayesian network , with the associated conditional probability tables Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. [ 87 ] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory , decision analysis , [ 88 ] and information value theory . [ 89 ] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes , [ 90 ] dynamic decision networks , [ 91 ] game theory and mechanism design . [ 92 ] Bayesian networks [ 93 ] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), [ g ] [ 95 ] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm ), [ h ] [ 97 ] planning (using decision networks ) [ 98 ] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks ). [ 91 ] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters ). [ 91 ] Expectation–maximization clustering of Old Faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption. Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., ""if shiny then diamond""), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., ""if diamond then pick up""), on the other hand. Classifiers [ 99 ] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning . Each pattern (also called an "" observation "") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set . When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience. [ 45 ] There are many kinds of classifiers in use. [ 100 ] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. [ 101 ] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. [ 102 ] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the ""most widely used learner"" [ 103 ] at Google, due in part to its scalability. [ 104 ] Neural networks are also used as classifiers. [ 105 ] Artificial neural networks A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain . An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons , which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers. [ 105 ] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. [ 106 ] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function. [ 107 ] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. [ 108 ] The term perceptron typically refers to a single-layer neural network. [ 109 ] In contrast, deep learning uses many layers. [ 110 ] Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to the vanishing gradient problem . [ 111 ] Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use layers of kernels to more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important in image processing , where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects. [ 112 ] Deep learning Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is itself a subset of artificial intelligence. [ 113 ] Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. [ 110 ] The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing , lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces. [ 114 ] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision , speech recognition , natural language processing , image classification , [ 115 ] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021. [ 116 ] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) [ i ] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs ) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet . [ j ] GPT Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called "" hallucinations "". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. [ 124 ] Such systems are used in chatbots , which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] Current models and services include ChatGPT , Claude , Gemini , Copilot , and Meta AI . [ 127 ] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data ( modalities ) such as images, videos, sound, and text. [ 128 ] Hardware and software Main articles: Programming languages for artificial intelligence and Hardware for artificial intelligence In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training. [ 129 ] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research, [ 130 ] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant. [ 131 ] The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore's law , named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore , who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster, [ 132 ] a trend sometimes called Huang's law , [ 133 ] named after Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang . Applications Main article: Applications of artificial intelligence AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search ), targeting online advertisements , recommendation systems (offered by Netflix , YouTube or Amazon ), driving internet traffic , targeted advertising ( AdSense , Facebook ), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa ), autonomous vehicles (including drones , ADAS and self-driving cars ), automatic language translation ( Microsoft Translator , Google Translate ), facial recognition ( Apple 's FaceID or Microsoft 's DeepFace and Google 's FaceNet ) and image labeling (used by Facebook , Apple's Photos and TikTok ). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a chief automation officer (CAO). Health and medicine Main article: Artificial intelligence in healthcare The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. [ 134 ] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath , medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data . This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. [ 137 ] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 139 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [ 140 ] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] Games Main article: Artificial intelligence in video games Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. [ 143 ] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov , on 11 May 1997. [ 144 ] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM 's question answering system , Watson , defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings , by a significant margin. [ 145 ] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol , becoming the first computer Go -playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps . Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie , who was the best Go player in the world. [ 146 ] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker -playing program Pluribus . [ 147 ] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero , which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. [ 148 ] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II , a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. [ 149 ] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. [ 150 ] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions. [ 151 ] Mathematics Large language models, such as GPT-4 , Gemini , Claude , Llama or Mistral , are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations . They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning [ 152 ] or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. [ 153 ] A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. [ 154 ] One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps, rather than just the correct result. [ 155 ] The Alibaba Group developed a version of its Qwen models called Qwen2-Math , that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84% accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems. [ 156 ] In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the technique rStar-Math that leverages Monte Carlo tree search and step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model like Qwen-7B to solve 53% of the AIME 2024 and 90% of the MATH benchmark problems. [ 157 ] Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as AlphaTensor , AlphaGeometry , AlphaProof and AlphaEvolve [ 158 ] all from Google DeepMind , [ 159 ] Llemma from EleutherAI [ 160 ] or Julius . [ 161 ] When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. The experimental model Gemini Deep Think accepts natural language prompts directly and achieved gold medal results in the International Math Olympiad of 2025. [ 162 ] Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics. [ 163 ] Topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches. Finance Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated ""robot advisers"" have been in use for some years. [ 164 ] According to Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions & Investments Forum , it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that ""the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation."" [ 165 ] Military Main article: Military applications of artificial intelligence Various countries are deploying AI military applications. [ 166 ] The main applications enhance command and control , communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. [ 167 ] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles . [ 166 ] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition , coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles, both human-operated and autonomous . [ 167 ] AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine. [ 166 ] [ 168 ] [ 169 ] [ 170 ] Generative AI Vincent van Gogh in watercolour created by generative AI software These paragraphs are an excerpt from Generative artificial intelligence . [ edit ] Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI, GenAI, [ 171 ] or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text, images , videos , audio , software code or other forms of data. [ 172 ] [ 173 ] These models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data [ 174 ] [ 175 ] based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural language prompts . [ 176 ] [ 177 ] Generative AI tools have become more common since the AI boom in the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements in transformer -based deep neural networks , particularly large language models (LLMs). Major tools include chatbots such as ChatGPT , Copilot , Gemini , Claude , Grok , and DeepSeek ; text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion , Midjourney , and DALL-E ; and text-to-video models such as Veo and Sora . [ 178 ] [ 179 ] [ 180 ] Technology companies developing generative AI include OpenAI , xAI , Anthropic , Meta AI , Microsoft , Google , Mistral AI , DeepSeek , Baidu [ 181 ] and Yandex . [ 182 ] Generative AI is used across many industries, including software development, [ 183 ] healthcare, [ 184 ] finance, [ 185 ] entertainment, [ 186 ] customer service, [ 187 ] sales and marketing, [ 188 ] art, writing, [ 189 ] fashion, [ 190 ] and product design. [ 191 ] The production of generative AI systems requires large scale data centers using specialized chips which require a lot of electricity for processing and water for cooling. [ 192 ] Agents Main article: Agentic AI AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants , chatbots , autonomous vehicles , game-playing systems , and industrial robotics . AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks. [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] Web search Microsoft introduced Copilot Search in February 2023 under the name Bing Chat , as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries [ 196 ] and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search. [ 197 ] For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content. [ 198 ] Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google I/O event on 20 May 2025. [ 199 ] It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result. AI Overviews uses Gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content. [ 200 ] Sexuality Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions, [ 201 ] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics ), [ 202 ] AI-generated sexual education content, [ 203 ] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika ). [ 204 ] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography , raising significant ethical and legal concerns. [ 205 ] AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors. [ 206 ] [ 207 ] Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated ""AI"" in some offerings or processes. [ 208 ] A few examples are energy storage , medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy , or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions. [ 209 ] [ 210 ] [ 211 ] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics , classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for ""classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights."" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the 2024 Indian elections , US$50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages. [ 212 ] Ethics Main article: Ethics of artificial intelligence Street art in Tel Aviv [ 213 ] [ 214 ] AI has potential benefits and potential risks. [ 215 ] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to ""solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else"". [ 216 ] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. [ 217 ] [ 218 ] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. [ 219 ] Risks and harm Privacy and copyright Further information: Information privacy and Artificial intelligence and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy , surveillance and copyright . AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio. [ 220 ] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. [ 221 ] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy . [ 222 ] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation , de-identification and differential privacy . [ 223 ] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork , have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness . Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted ""from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'."" [ 224 ] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of "" fair use "". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include ""the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work"" and ""the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work"". [ 225 ] [ 226 ] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a "" robots.txt "" file. [ 227 ] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen ) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors. [ 230 ] Dominance by tech giants The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc. , Amazon , Apple Inc. , Meta Platforms , and Microsoft . [ 231 ] [ 232 ] [ 233 ] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers , allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace. [ 234 ] [ 235 ] Power needs and environmental impacts See also: Environmental impacts of artificial intelligence In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026 , forecasting electric power use. [ 236 ] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation. [ 237 ] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and ""intelligent"", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms. [ 238 ] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge , found ""US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation...."" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. [ 239 ] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all. [ 240 ] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US$650 million. [ 241 ] Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers. [ 242 ] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission . If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US$1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act . [ 243 ] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US$2 billion to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation. [ 244 ] After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages. [ 245 ] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025. [ 245 ] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban. [ 245 ] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident , according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. [ 246 ] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI. [ 246 ] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center. [ 247 ] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips , it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors. [ 247 ] In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300–500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5% of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5% of the energy sector emissions, but rebound effects (for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it. [ 248 ] Misinformation See also: Content moderation YouTube , Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation , conspiracy theories , and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. [ 249 ] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. [ 250 ] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem. [ 251 ] In the early 2020s, generative AI began to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing, [ 252 ] while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s. [ 253 ] [ 254 ] [ 255 ] It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda; [ 256 ] one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda . [ 257 ] AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling ""authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates"" on a large scale, among other risks. [ 258 ] AI researchers at Microsoft , OpenAI , universities and other organisations have suggested using "" personhood credentials "" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models. [ 259 ] Algorithmic bias and fairness Main articles: Algorithmic bias and Fairness (machine learning) Machine learning applications can be biased [ k ] if they learn from biased data. [ 261 ] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. [ 262 ] Discriminatory behavior by some LLMs can be observed in their output. [ 263 ] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. [ 264 ] [ 261 ] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine , finance , recruitment , housing or policing ) then the algorithm may cause discrimination . [ 265 ] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On 28 June 2015, Google Photos 's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as ""gorillas"" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, [ 266 ] a problem called ""sample size disparity"". [ 267 ] Google ""fixed"" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a ""gorilla"". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon. [ 268 ] COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist . In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. [ 269 ] In 2017, several researchers [ l ] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data. [ 271 ] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as ""race"" or ""gender""). The feature will correlate with other features (like ""address"", ""shopping history"" or ""first name""), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on ""race"" or ""gender"". [ 272 ] Moritz Hardt said ""the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work."" [ 273 ] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make ""predictions"" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations , some of these ""recommendations"" will likely be racist. [ 274 ] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive. [ m ] Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women. [ 267 ] There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness , which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws . [ 260 ] At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery , in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed. [ dubious – discuss ] [ 276 ] Lack of transparency See also: Explainable AI , Algorithmic transparency , and Right to explanation Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. [ 277 ] Particularly with deep neural networks , in which there are many non- linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist. [ 278 ] It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as ""cancerous"", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. [ 279 ] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at ""low risk"" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading. [ 280 ] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. [ 281 ] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. [ n ] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used. [ 282 ] DARPA established the XAI (""Explainable Artificial Intelligence"") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems. [ 283 ] Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. [ 284 ] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. [ 285 ] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. [ 286 ] Deconvolution , DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. [ 287 ] For generative pre-trained transformers , Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts. [ 288 ] Bad actors and weaponized AI Main articles: Lethal autonomous weapon , Artificial intelligence arms race , and AI safety Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors , such as authoritarian governments , terrorists , criminals or rogue states . A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. [ o ] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction . [ 290 ] Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person . [ 290 ] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations ' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons , however the United States and others disagreed. [ 291 ] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots. [ 292 ] AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance . Machine learning , operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision-making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets . It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware . [ 293 ] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China. [ 294 ] [ 295 ] There are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours. [ 296 ] Technological unemployment Main articles: Workplace impact of artificial intelligence and Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. [ 297 ] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that ""we're in uncharted territory"" with AI. [ 298 ] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment , but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed . [ 299 ] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at ""high risk"" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as ""high risk"". [ p ] [ 301 ] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. [ 297 ] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. [ 302 ] [ 303 ] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that ""the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution"" is ""worth taking seriously"". [ 304 ] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy. [ 305 ] In July 2025, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that ""artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S."" [ 306 ] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum , about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement. [ 307 ] Existential risk Main article: Existential risk from artificial intelligence It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, "" spell the end of the human race "". [ 308 ] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like ""self-awareness"" (or ""sentience"" or ""consciousness"") and becomes a malevolent character. [ q ] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like sentience to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of an automated paperclip factory that destroys the world to get more iron for paperclips). [ 310 ] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that ""you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead."" [ 311 ] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is ""fundamentally on our side"". [ 312 ] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies , law , government , money and the economy are built on language ; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive. [ 313 ] Geoffrey Hinton said in 2025 that modern AI is particularly ""good at persuasion"" and getting better all the time. He asks ""Suppose you wanted to invade the capital of the US. Do you have to go there and do it yourself? No. You just have to be good at persuasion."" [ 314 ] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. [ 315 ] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking , Bill Gates , and Elon Musk , [ 316 ] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio , Stuart Russell , Demis Hassabis , and Sam Altman , have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to ""freely speak out about the risks of AI"" without ""considering how this impacts Google"". [ 317 ] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover , [ 318 ] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI. [ 319 ] In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsed the joint statement that ""Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war"". [ 320 ] Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneer Jürgen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making ""human lives longer and healthier and easier."" [ 321 ] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, ""they can also be used against the bad actors."" [ 322 ] [ 323 ] Andrew Ng also argued that ""it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests."" [ 324 ] Yann LeCun ""scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction."" [ 325 ] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. [ 326 ] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research. [ 327 ] Ethical machines and alignment Main articles: Machine ethics , AI safety , Friendly artificial intelligence , Artificial moral agents , and Human Compatible Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky , who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk. [ 328 ] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. [ 329 ] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, [ 329 ] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005. [ 330 ] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach 's ""artificial moral agents"" [ 331 ] and Stuart J. Russell 's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. [ 332 ] Open source See also: Lists of open-source artificial intelligence software Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face , [ 333 ] Google , [ 334 ] EleutherAI and Meta . [ 335 ] Various AI models, such as Llama 2 , Mistral or Stable Diffusion , have been made open-weight, [ 336 ] [ 337 ] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the ""weights"") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned , which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. [ 338 ] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism ) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses. [ 339 ] Frameworks Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by the Alan Turing Institute and based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows: [ 340 ] [ 341 ] Respect the dignity of individual people Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively Care for the wellbeing of everyone Protect social values, justice, and the public interest Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference , the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; [ 342 ] however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks. [ 343 ] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers. [ 344 ] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. [ 345 ] Regulation Main articles: Regulation of artificial intelligence , Regulation of algorithms , and AI safety The first global AI Safety Summit was held in the United Kingdom in November 2023 with a declaration calling for international cooperation. The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. [ 346 ] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. [ 347 ] According to AI Index at Stanford , the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. [ 348 ] [ 349 ] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. [ 350 ] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada , China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. [ 350 ] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. [ 350 ] Henry Kissinger , Eric Schmidt , and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. [ 351 ] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. [ 352 ] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics. [ 353 ] On 1 August 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act entered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation. [ 354 ] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the "" Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law "". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories. [ 355 ] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that ""products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks"". [ 348 ] A 2023 Reuters /Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. [ 356 ] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it ""very important"", and an additional 41% thought it ""somewhat important"", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding ""not very important"" and 8% responding ""not at all important"". [ 357 ] [ 358 ] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. [ 359 ] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. [ 360 ] [ 361 ] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit , 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] History Main article: History of artificial intelligence For a chronological guide, see Timeline of artificial intelligence . In 2024, AI patents in China and the US numbered more than three-fourths of AI patents worldwide. [ 364 ] Though China had more AI patents, the US had 35% more patents per AI patent-applicant company than China. [ 364 ] The study of mechanical or ""formal"" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as ""0"" and ""1"", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. [ 365 ] [ 366 ] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics , information theory and neurobiology , led researchers to consider the possibility of building an ""electronic brain"". [ r ] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, [ 368 ] such as McCulloch and Pitts design for ""artificial neurons"" in 1943, [ 117 ] and Turing's influential 1950 paper ' Computing Machinery and Intelligence ', which introduced the Turing test and showed that ""machine intelligence"" was plausible. [ 369 ] [ 366 ] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. [ s ] [ 6 ] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. [ t ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as ""astonishing"": [ u ] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. [ v ] [ 7 ] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s. [ 366 ] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. [ 373 ] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, ""machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do"". [ 374 ] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that ""within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved"". [ 375 ] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. [ w ] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill [ 377 ] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects . [ 378 ] Minsky and Papert 's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. [ 379 ] The "" AI winter "", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed. [ 9 ] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 380 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 8 ] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began. [ 10 ] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception , robotics , learning and pattern recognition , [ 381 ] and began to look into ""sub-symbolic"" approaches. [ 382 ] Rodney Brooks rejected ""representation"" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. [ x ] Judea Pearl , Lotfi Zadeh , and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. [ 87 ] [ 387 ] But the most important development was the revival of "" connectionism "", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. [ 388 ] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks. [ 389 ] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "" narrow "" and ""formal"" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics , economics and mathematics ). [ 390 ] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as ""artificial intelligence"" (a tendency known as the AI effect ). [ 391 ] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or ""AGI""), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s. [ 68 ] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. [ 11 ] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned. [ y ] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements ( faster computers , [ 393 ] graphics processing units , cloud computing [ 394 ] ) and access to large amounts of data [ 395 ] (including curated datasets, [ 394 ] such as ImageNet ). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. [ z ] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019. [ 350 ] The number of Google searches for the term ""AI"" accelerated in 2022. In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. [ 327 ] In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo , developed by DeepMind , beat the world champion Go player . The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. [ 396 ] ChatGPT , launched on 30 November 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. [ 397 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 398 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US$50 billion annually was invested in ""AI"" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in ""AI"". [ 399 ] About 800,000 ""AI""-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 400 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 401 ] Philosophy Main article: Philosophy of artificial intelligence Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. [ 402 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. [ 403 ] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will . [ 404 ] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI . [ 403 ] Defining artificial intelligence See also: Synthetic intelligence , Intelligent agent , Artificial mind , Virtual intelligence , and Dartmouth workshop Alan Turing wrote in 1950 ""I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"" [ 405 ] He advised changing the question from whether a machine ""thinks"", to ""whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour"". [ 405 ] He devised the Turing test , which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. [ 369 ] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is ""actually"" thinking or literally has a ""mind"". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but ""it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks."" [ 406 ] The Turing test can provide some evidence of intelligence, but it penalizes non-human intelligent behavior. [ 407 ] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. [ 1 ] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. "" Aeronautical engineering texts"", they wrote, ""do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' "" [ 408 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that ""Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence"". [ 409 ] McCarthy defines intelligence as ""the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world"". [ 410 ] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky , similarly describes it as ""the ability to solve hard problems"". [ 411 ] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. [ 1 ] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the ""intelligence"" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google, [ 412 ] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself [ 413 ] including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses. [ 414 ] Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms, [ 415 ] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword , often even if they did ""not actually use AI in a material way"". [ 416 ] There has been debate over whether large language models exhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it by imitating human text . [ 417 ] Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. [ aa ] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term ""artificial intelligence"" to mean ""machine learning with neural networks""). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic , soft and narrow . Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI (or "" GOFAI "") [ 419 ] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at ""intelligent"" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis : ""A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."" [ 420 ] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning . Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level ""intelligent"" tasks were easy for AI, but low level ""instinctive"" tasks were extremely difficult. [ 421 ] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a ""feel"" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. [ 422 ] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him. [ ab ] [ 16 ] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias . Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, [ 424 ] [ 425 ] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI : it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. Neat vs. scruffy Main article: Neats and scruffies ""Neats"" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic , optimization , or neural networks ). ""Scruffies"" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, [ 426 ] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Soft vs. hard computing Main article: Soft computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. [ 15 ] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms , fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI Main articles: Weak artificial intelligence and Artificial general intelligence AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. [ 427 ] [ 428 ] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind Main articles: Philosophy of artificial intelligence and Artificial consciousness There is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind , consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that ""[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on."" [ 429 ] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction . Consciousness Main articles: Hard problem of consciousness and Theory of mind David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the ""hard"" and ""easy"" problems of consciousness. [ 430 ] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like . [ 431 ] Computationalism and functionalism Main articles: Computational theory of mind and Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem . This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam . [ 432 ] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as "" strong AI "": ""The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."" [ ac ] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind. [ 436 ] AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. [ 437 ] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. [ 438 ] [ 439 ] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness ) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. [ 438 ] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society. [ 440 ] In 2017, the European Union considered granting ""electronic personhood"" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. [ 441 ] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights , and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own. [ 442 ] [ 443 ] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming , which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited. [ 439 ] [ 438 ] Future Superintelligence and the singularity A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. [ 428 ] If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself . The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an "" intelligence explosion "" and Vernor Vinge called a "" singularity "". [ 444 ] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve , slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. [ 445 ] Transhumanism Main article: Transhumanism Robot designer Hans Moravec , cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger . [ 446 ] Edward Fredkin argues that ""artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution"", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler 's "" Darwin among the Machines "" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . [ 447 ] In fiction Main article: Artificial intelligence in fiction The word ""robot"" itself was coined by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play R.U.R. , the title standing for ""Rossum's Universal Robots"". Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, [ 448 ] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction . [ 449 ] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein , where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000 , the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture. [ 450 ] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the "" Multivac "" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; [ 451 ] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity. [ 452 ] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel , and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek 's R.U.R. , the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina , as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? , by Philip K. Dick . Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.

[ 43 ] ^ See AI winter § Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966 ^ Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive.

But in the context of fairness , it refers to a tendency in favor or against a certain group or individual characteristic, usually in a way that is considered unfair or harmful.

Instead, the United States has developed a new area of dominance that the rest of the world views with a mixture of awe, envy, and resentment: artificial intelligence... From AI models and research to cloud computing and venture capital, U.S. companies, universities, and research labs – and their affiliates in allied countries – appear to have an enormous lead in both developing cutting-edge AI and commercializing it. The value of U.S. venture capital investments in AI start-ups exceeds that of the rest of the world combined. Gertner, Jon.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Sometimes, AI is used to talk about neural networks or deep learning . [ 3 ] Artificial intelligence is a system's ability to understand external data , to learn from that data, and to use what it has learned to achieve specific goals or tasks through adaptation . [ 4 ] Artificial intelligence is widely applied in speech recognition , image recognition , robotics , autonomous systems , natural language processing , machine translation , predictive analytics , medical diagnostics , fraud detection , and the control of physical processes . Origin of name [ change | change source ] John McCarthy came up with the name, ""artificial intelligence"" in 1956. Intelligence allows an organism to act in a meaningful way in its environment. It includes the ability to get sensory inputs, and to react to these. Laws [ change | change source ] The European Union made a law (2024's second quarter) about artificial intelligence . It is the world's first law that regulates AI. [ 5 ] Connecticut and Colorado tried to pass laws (in 2024) regarding use of AI. [ 6 ] History [ change | change source ] AI research started with a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. It was a month-long brainstorming session many people who like AI came to. At the conference, they wrote programs which were able to beat humans at checkers or solving word problems. The Department of Defense started giving a lot of money to AI research, and labs were created all over the world. In a paper on AI, mathematician James Lighthill wrote "" no aspect of the discipline has so far seen discoveries generated the huge influence that was previously anticipated In no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised."" [1] .  The governments of the US and UK decided to spend money on other projects which caused little new research to be done. This was known as an ""AI winter."" [ 7 ] In the 90s and early 2000s, AI became important again in data mining and medical diagnosis. This was possible because of faster computers and focusing on solving more specific problems. Deep Blue, a chess computer that became famous (1997) In 1997, the chess computer Deep Blue became the first computer program to beat chess world champion Garry Kasparov . In 2011, IBM Watson beat the top two Jeopardy! players Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings . In 2016, Google's AlphaGo beat top Go player Lee Sedol 4 out of 5 times. The idea is perhaps much older. Julien Offray de La Mettrie (1709-1751) was a materialist thinker of the Enlightenment . In his work of 1748, L'Homme Machine, he had the idea that both matter and life organized themselves. [ 8 ] He is seen as one of the precursors of Darwin's theory of evolution . [ 9 ] Today, one field of artificial intelligence, called strong artificial intelligence wants to build a machine that can think like a person. [ 10 ] However, weak artificial intelligence is about building a system that can support a human. One of the key problems is to make systems that can model wikt:uncertainity . Most of the time, this is done with probability theory and statistics . Uses [ change | change source ] Artificial intelligence is used in many different areas today. Healthcare (see Artificial intelligence in healthcare ) AI helps doctors diagnose diseases and find treatments for patients. Industry-specific tasks ; AI applications are used to solve problems in a workplace , industry, or institutions . Finance : Banks use AI to find fraud and make trading decisions. Customer service : Many companies use AI chatbots to answer customer questions and provide support. Personal assistants : AI assistants like Siri and Alexa help people manage their daily tasks. Entertainment : AI is used in video games to create smart, responsive characters and stories that change in fun ways based on what the player does. AI is used to create videos now-a-days by using different models like Sora . Those subjects are part of Game artificial intelligence . Military ( Military artificial intelligence ) Generative AI (or Generative artificial intelligence ) Some software has become well-known, such as ChatGPT (a chatbot and virtual assistant ). Domains [ change | change source ] There are different domains of artificial intelligence. Pattern recognition like speech , writing, and handwriting Knowledge engineering like logic programming and inference engines Expert systems for question answering and Chatbots Machine learning Artificial neural networks and deep learning Computer vision Robotics General game playing Artificial life Types and classes [ change | change source ] Researchers Kaplan and Haenlein say there are three types of AI system: analytical, human-inspired, and humanized artificial intelligence. [ 4 ] Analytical A.I. has similarities with cognitive intelligence which tries to understand the world and make decisions based on that. Human-inspired A.I. which tries to be more ""human"" with cognitive intelligence with emotional intelligence . Humanized A.I. is able to understand human social activity and is able to be self aware [ 11 ] Controversies [ change | change source ] In 2025, a municipality in Norway made a report in regard to permanently closing down schools; The report used ghost source (or fictitious sources); Those sources were claimed to be the works of two (named) professors; The municipality admitted that the report was made [partly] by A.I.; The process of closing down schools, has stopped (as of March). [ 12 ] An official that was involved, resigned (or left her job) one month later. [ 13 ] (See Hallucination, artificial intelligence ) Other information [ change | change source ] Trivia sections are NOT encouraged under Wikipedia guidelines . Please improve this article by integrating relevant items and removing inappropriate ones. A.I. chips are a kind of computer chip , according to media. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Researchers didn't know how difficult several issues were. They still couldn't offer computers things like emotions or common sense . Faster computers, deep learning, and more data have made AI popular throughout the world. [ 16 ] An great intelligent machine is flexible and perceives what is around it. It would use what it learns to make its chance of success at some goal better. [ 17 ] AI has been successful with decoding human speech , [ 1 ] playing games (like chess and Go ), self-driving cars , and understanding complex data. [ 18 ] Someday, AI researchers hope to create computer programs that can learn, solve problems, and think logically. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] So far, most AI programs only do what computers can do well like searching databases or doing calculations. AI is not able to sense and understand what is happening around itself because of problems with what computers can do. AI involves many different fields like computer science , mathematics , linguistics , psychology , neuroscience , and philosophy . Researchers hope to make a ""general artificial intelligence"" which can solve many problems instead of focusing on just one. Researchers are also trying to make creative and emotional AI which could create art. Alan Turing wrote in 1950 ""I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"" [ 21 ] He said the question should be changed from if a machine ""thinks"" to ""whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behavior"". [ 21 ] Alan Turing also created the Turing test . This is a very general test. If a human cannot tell if at the other end of the line, there is a machine or a human answering questions, the machine is intelligent. The authors of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach agree with Turing that AI must be defined by ""acting"" and not ""thinking"". [ 22 ] But they don't think the test compares machines to people . "" Aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ' "" [ 23 ] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that ""Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence"". [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Computers can do some things like learning and problem solving , but not in the same way as people do. [ 1 ] Interestingly, advancements in AI have expanded its applications, including the use of Large language models (LLMs) to ""humanize"" AI-generated text. This reflects a growing interest in bridging the gap between machine outputs and human-like expression. [ 26 ] AI and machine learning technology is used in applications including: search engines , recommendation systems , virtual assistants , autonomous vehicles , automatic language translation , facial recognition , image labeling , advertising, and driving internet traffic . One interesting use of AI is in helping people with their personal relationships. For example, ChatGPT is a powerful AI tool that can create human-like text and assist in many communication tasks. [ 25 ] Optical character recognition is no longer thought of as an example of ""artificial intelligence"" since it's now commonly used.

( August 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Advertising revenue as a percent of US GDP shows a rise in digital advertising since 1995 at the expense of print media.

[ 2 ] [ 3 ] It has significantly transformed the way brands and businesses utilize technology for marketing since the 1990s and 2000s. As digital platforms became increasingly incorporated into marketing plans and everyday life, [ 4 ] and as people increasingly used digital devices instead of visiting physical shops, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent, employing combinations of methods. Some of these methods include: search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), content marketing , influencer marketing , content automation, campaign marketing, data -driven marketing, e-commerce marketing, social media marketing , social media optimization , e-mail direct marketing , display advertising , e-books , and optical disks and games. Digital marketing extends to non-Internet channels that provide digital media, such as television , mobile phones ( SMS and MMS ), callbacks, and on-hold mobile ringtones. [ 7 ] The extension to non-Internet channels differentiates digital marketing from online marketing . [ 8 ] History Digital marketing effectively began in 1990 when the Archie search engine was created as an index for FTP sites. In the 1980s, the storage capacity of computers was already large enough to store huge volumes of customer information. Companies started choosing online techniques, such as database marketing , rather than limited list brokers . [ 9 ] Databases allowed companies to track customers' information more effectively, transforming the relationship between buyer and seller. In the 1990s, the term digital marketing was coined. [ citation needed ] The first clickable banner ad , the ""You Will"" campaign by AT&T , went live in 1994, and over the first four months, 44% of all people who saw it clicked on the ad. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Early digital marketing efforts focused on simple HTML websites and the burgeoning practice of email marketing, which allowed for direct communication with consumers. [ 12 ] In the 2000s, with increasing numbers of Internet users and the birth of the iPhone , customers began searching for products and making decisions about their needs online first, instead of consulting a salesperson , which created a new problem for the marketing department of a company. [ 13 ] In addition, a survey in 2000 in the United Kingdom found that most retailers still needed to register their own domain address. [ 14 ] These problems encouraged marketers to find new ways to integrate digital technology into market development. At the same time, pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, introduced by Google AdWords in 2000, allowed businesses to target specific keywords, making digital marketing more measurable and cost-effective. [ 15 ] The mid-2000s saw the emergence of social media platforms like Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), and Twitter (2006). These platforms revolutionized digital marketing by facilitating direct and interactive engagement with consumers. In 2007, marketing automation was developed as a response to the ever-evolving marketing climate. Marketing automation is the process by which software is used to automate conventional marketing processes. [ 16 ] Marketing automation helps companies segment customers, launch multichannel marketing campaigns, and provide personalized information for customers., [ 16 ] based on their specific activities. In this way, users' activity (or lack thereof) triggers a personal message that is customized to the user in their preferred platform. However, despite the benefits of marketing automation many companies are struggling to adapt it to their everyday uses correctly. [ 17 ] [ page needed ] Digital marketing became more sophisticated in the 2000s and the 2010s,
when [ 18 ] [ 19 ] the proliferation of devices capable of accessing digital media led to sudden growth. [ 20 ] Statistics produced in 2012 and 2013 showed that digital marketing was still growing. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] With the development of social media in the 2000s, such as LinkedIn , Facebook , YouTube , and Twitter , consumers became highly dependent on digital electronics in their daily lives. Therefore, they expected a seamless user experience across different channels for searching product information. The change in customer behavior improved the diversification of marketing technology. [ 23 ] Digital media growth was estimated at 4.5 trillion online ads served annually with digital media spending at 48% growth in 2010. [ 24 ] An increasing portion of advertising stems from businesses employing Online Behavioural Advertising (OBA) to tailor advertising for internet users, but OBA raises concerns about consumer privacy and data protection . [ 20 ] Non-linear marketing approach Nonlinear marketing, a type of interactive marketing, is a long-term marketing approach that builds on businesses collecting information about an Internet user's online activities and trying to be visible in multiple areas. [ 25 ] Unlike traditional marketing techniques, which involve direct, one-way messaging to consumers (via print, television , and radio advertising), nonlinear digital marketing strategies are centered on reaching prospective customers across multiple online channels. [ citation needed ] Combined with higher consumer knowledge and the demand for more sophisticated consumer offerings, this change has forced many businesses to rethink their outreach strategy and adopt or incorporate omnichannel, nonlinear marketing techniques to maintain sufficient brand exposure, engagement, and reach. [ citation needed ] Nonlinear marketing strategies involve efforts to adapt the advertising to different platforms [ 26 ] and to tailor the advertising to different individual buyers rather than a large coherent audience. [ 27 ] Tactics may include: Search engine optimization (SEO) Social media marketing Video marketing Email marketing Blogging & affiliate marketing Website marketing Pay-per-click Content marketing Search engine marketing Social media optimization Some studies indicate that consumer responses to traditional marketing approaches are becoming less predictable for businesses. [ 28 ] According to a 2018 study, nearly 90% of online consumers in the United States researched products and brands online before visiting the store or making a purchase. [ 29 ] The Global Web Index estimated that in 2018, a little more than 50% of consumers researched products on social media. [ 30 ] Businesses often rely on individuals portraying their products in a positive light on social media, and may adapt their marketing strategy to target people with large social media followings in order to generate such comments. [ 31 ] In this manner, businesses can use consumers to advertise their products or services, decreasing the cost for the company. [ 32 ] Brand awareness Main article: Brand awareness One of the key objectives of modern digital marketing is to raise brand awareness , the extent to which customers and the public are familiar with and recognize a particular brand. Enhancing brand awareness is important in digital marketing, and marketing in general, because of its impact on brand perception and consumer decision-making. According to the 2015 essay, ""Impact of Brand on Consumer Behavior"": ""Brand awareness, as one of the fundamental dimensions of brand equity , is often considered to be a prerequisite of consumers' buying decision, as it represents the main factor for including a brand in the consideration set . Brand awareness can also influence consumers' perceived risk assessment and their confidence in the purchase decision, due to familiarity with the brand and its characteristics."" [ 33 ] Recent trends show that businesses and digital marketers are prioritizing brand awareness, focusing more on their digital marketing efforts on cultivating brand recognition and recall than in previous years. This is evidenced by a 2019 Content Marketing Institute study, which found that 81% of digital marketers have worked on enhancing brand recognition over the past year. [ 34 ] Another Content Marketing Institute survey revealed that 89% of B2B marketers now believe improving brand awareness to be more important than efforts directed at increasing sales. [ 35 ] Increasing brand awareness is a focus of digital marketing strategy for a number of reasons: The growth of online shopping. A survey by Statista projects 230.5 million people in the United States will use the Internet to shop, compare, and buy products by 2021, up from 209.6 million in 2016. [ 36 ] Research from business software firm Salesforce found that 87% of people began searches for products and brands on digital channels in 2018. [ 37 ] The role of digital interaction in customer behavior. It's estimated that 70% of all retail purchases made in the U.S. are influenced to some degree by an interaction with a brand online. [ 38 ] The growing influence and role of brand awareness in online consumer decision-making: 82% of online shoppers searching for services give preference to brands they know of. [ 39 ] The use, convenience, and influence of social media. A recent report by Hootsuite estimated there were more than 3.4 billion active users on social media platforms, a 9% increase from 2018. [ 40 ] A 2019 survey by The Manifest states that 74% of social media users follow brands on social sites, and 96% of people who follow businesses also engage with those brands on social platforms. [ 41 ] According to Deloitte, one in three U.S. consumers are influenced by social media when buying a product, while 47% of millennials factor their interaction with a brand on social when making a purchase. [ 42 ] Online methods used to build brand awareness Digital marketing strategies may include the use of one or more online channels and techniques (omnichannel) to increase brand awareness among consumers. Building brand awareness may involve such methods/tools as: Search engine optimization (SEO) Search engine optimization techniques may be used to improve the visibility of business websites and brand-related content for common industry-related search queries. [ 43 ] The importance of SEO to increase brand awareness is said to correlate with the growing influence of search results and search features like featured snippets, knowledge panels, and local SEO on customer behavior. [ 44 ] Search engine marketing (SEM) SEM, also known as PPC advertising, involves the purchase of ad space in prominent, visible positions atop search results pages and websites. Search ads have been shown to have a positive impact on brand recognition, awareness and conversions. [ 45 ] Further information: Conversion as a service 33% of searchers who click on paid ads do so because they directly respond to their particular search query. [ 46 ] Social media marketing Social media marketing is characterized by its constant engagement with consumers, emphasizing content creation and interaction skills. It involves real-time monitoring, analysis, summarization, and management of the marketing process, performed via platforms like Hootsuite or Sprout Social , which support these activities and allow adjustments to marketing strategies based on real-time feedback from the market and consumers. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] 70% of marketers list increasing brand awareness as their number one goal for marketing on social media platforms. [ citation needed ] As of 2021, LinkedIn has been added as one of the most-used social media platforms by business leaders for its professional networking capabilities. [ 49 ] Content marketing 56% of marketers believe personalization content – brand-centered blogs, articles, social updates, videos, landing pages – improves brand recall and engagement. [ 50 ] Developments and strategies One of the major changes that occurred in traditional marketing was the ""emergence of digital marketing"", this led to the reinvention of marketing strategies in order to adapt to this major change in traditional marketing. As digital marketing is dependent on technology which is ever-evolving and fast-changing, the same features should be expected from digital marketing developments and strategies. This section attempts to list the notable current highlights in use (at the time of writing). [ when? ] Segmentation : More focus has been placed on segmentation within digital marketing, in order to target specific markets in both business-to-business and business-to-consumer sectors. Influencer marketing : Important nodes are identified within related communities, known as influencers. This is becoming an important concept in digital targeting. [ 51 ] Influencers allow brands to take advantage of social media and the large audiences available on many of these platforms. [ 51 ] It is possible to reach influencers via paid advertising, such as Facebook Advertising or Google Ads campaigns, or through sophisticated sCRM (social customer relationship management) software, such as SAP C4C, Microsoft Dynamics, Sage CRM and Salesforce CRM. Many universities now focus, at Masters level, on engagement strategies for influencers. To summarize, Pull digital marketing is characterized by consumers actively seeking marketing content while Push digital marketing occurs when marketers send messages without that content being actively sought by the recipients. Online behavioral advertising is the practice of collecting information about a user's online activity over time, ""on a particular device and across different, unrelated websites, in order to deliver advertisements tailored to that user's interests and preferences."" [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Such Advertisements are based on site retargeting are customized based on each user behavior and pattern. Collaborative Environment : A collaborative environment can be set up between the organization, the technology service provider, and the digital agencies to optimize effort, resource sharing, reusability and communications. [ 54 ] Additionally, organizations are inviting their customers to help them better understand how to service them. This source of data is called user-generated content . Much of this is acquired via company websites where the organization invites people to share ideas that are then evaluated by other users of the site. The most popular ideas are evaluated and implemented in some form. Using this method of acquiring data and developing new products can foster the organization's relationship with its customer as well as spawn ideas that would otherwise be overlooked. UGC is low-cost advertising as it is directly from the consumers and can save advertising costs for the organization. Data-driven advertising: Users generate a lot of data in every step they take on the path of customer journey and brands can now use that data to activate their known audience with data-driven programmatic media buying. Without exposing customers' privacy, users' data can be collected from digital channels (e.g.: when the customer visits a website, reads an e-mail, or launches and interact with a brand's mobile app), brands can also collect data from real-world customer interactions, such as brick and mortar stores visits and from CRM and sales engines datasets. Also known as people-based marketing or addressable media, data-driven advertising is empowering brands to find their loyal customers in their audience and deliver in real time a much more personal communication, highly relevant to each customers' moment and actions. [ 55 ] An important consideration today while deciding on a strategy is that the digital tools have democratized the promotional landscape. Remarketing: Remarketing plays a major role in digital marketing. This tactic allows marketers to publish targeted ads in front of an interest category or a defined audience, generally called searchers in web speak, they have either searched for particular products or services or visited a website for some purpose. Game advertising : Game ads are advertisements that exist within computer or video games. One of the most common examples of in-game advertising is billboards appearing in sports games. In-game ads also might appear as brand-name products like guns, cars, or clothing that exist as gaming status symbols. Six principles for building online brand content: [ 56 ] Do not consider individuals as consumers; Have an editorial position; Define an identity for the brand; Maintain a continuity of contents; Ensure a regular interaction with audience; Have a channel for events. Tourism marketing: Advanced tourism, responsible and sustainable tourism, social media and online tourism marketing, and geographic information systems. As a broader research field matures and attracts more diverse and in-depth academic research. [ 57 ] The new digital era has enabled brands to selectively target their customers that may potentially be interested in their brand or based on previous browsing interests. Businesses can use social media to select the age range, location, gender, and interests of whom they would like their targeted post to be seen. Furthermore, based on a customer's recent search history they can be 'followed' on the internet so they see advertisements from similar brands, products, and services, [ 58 ] that allows businesses to target the specific customers that they know and feel will most benefit from their product or service, something that had limited capabilities up until the digital era. Ineffective forms of digital marketing Digital marketing activity is still growing across the world according to the headline global marketing index. A study published in September 2018, found that global outlays on digital marketing tactics are approaching $100 billion. [ 59 ] Digital media continues to rapidly grow. While the marketing budgets are expanding, traditional media is declining. [ 60 ] Digital media helps brands reach consumers to engage with their product or service in a personalized way. Five areas, which are outlined as current industry practices that are often ineffective are prioritizing clicks, balancing search and display, understanding mobiles, targeting, viewability, brand safety and invalid traffic, and cross-platform measurement. [ 61 ] Why these practices are ineffective and some ways around making these aspects effective are discussed surrounding the following points. Prioritizing clicks Prioritizing clicks refers to display click ads, although advantageous by being 'simple, fast and inexpensive' rates for display ads in 2016 is only 0.10 percent in the United States. This means one in a thousand click ads is relevant therefore having little effect. This displays that marketing companies should not just use click ads to evaluate the effectiveness of display advertisements. [ 61 ] Balancing search and display Balancing search and display for digital display ads is important. marketers tend to look at the last search and attribute all of the effectiveness of this. This, in turn, disregards other marketing efforts, which establish brand value within the consumer's mind. ComScore determined through drawing on data online, produced by over one hundred multichannel retailers that digital display marketing poses strengths when compared with or positioned alongside, paid search. [ 61 ] This is why it is advised that when someone clicks on a display ad the company opens a landing page, not its home page. A landing page typically has something to draw the customer in to search beyond this page. Commonly marketers see increased sales among people exposed to a search ad. But the fact of how many people you can reach with a display campaign compared to a search campaign should be considered.  Multichannel retailers have an increased reach if the display is considered in synergy with search campaigns. Overall, both search and display aspects are valued as display campaigns build awareness for the brand so that more people are likely to click on these digital ads when running a search campaign. [ 61 ] Understanding Mobiles Understanding mobile devices is a significant aspect of digital marketing because smartphones and tablets are now responsible for 64% of the time US consumers are online. [ 61 ] Apps provide a big opportunity as well as challenge for the marketers because firstly the app needs to be downloaded and secondly the person needs to actually use it. This may be difficult as 'half the time spent on smartphone apps occurs on the individuals single most used app, and almost 85% of their time on the top four rated apps'. [ 61 ] Mobile advertising can assist in achieving a variety of commercial objectives and it is effective due to taking over the entire screen, and voice or status is likely to be considered highly. However, the message must not be seen or thought of as intrusive. [ 61 ] Disadvantages of digital media used on mobile devices also include limited creative capabilities, and reach.  Although there are many positive aspects including the user's entitlement to select product information, digital media creating a flexible message platform and there is potential for direct selling. [ 62 ] Cross-platform measurement The number of marketing channels continues to expand, as measurement practices are growing in complexity. A cross-platform view must be used to unify audience measurement and media planning. Market researchers need to understand how the Omni-channel affects consumer's behavior, although when advertisements are on a consumer's device this does not get measured. Significant aspects to cross-platform measurement involve deduplication and understanding that you have reached an incremental level with another platform, rather than delivering more impressions against people that have previously been reached. [ 61 ] An example is 'ESPN and comScore partnered on Project Blueprint discovering the sports broadcaster achieved a 21% increase in unduplicated daily reach thanks to digital advertising'. [ 61 ] Television and radio industries are the electronic media, which competes with digital and other technological advertising. Yet television advertising is not directly competing with online digital advertising due to being able to cross platform with digital technology. Radio also gains power through cross platforms, in online streaming content. Television and radio continue to persuade and affect the audience, across multiple platforms. [ 63 ] Targeting, viewability, brand safety, and invalid traffic Targeting, viewability, brand safety, and invalid traffic all are aspects used by marketers to help advocate digital advertising. Cookies are a form of digital advertising, which are tracking tools within desktop devices, causing difficulty, with shortcomings including deletion by web browsers, the inability to sort between multiple users of a device, inaccurate estimates for unique visitors, overstating reach, understanding frequency, problems with ad servers, which cannot distinguish between when cookies have been deleted and when consumers have not previously been exposed to an ad. Due to the inaccuracies influenced by cookies, demographics in the target market are low and vary. [ 61 ] Another element, which is affected by digital marketing, is 'viewability' or whether the ad was actually seen by the consumer. Many ads are not seen by a consumer and may never reach the right demographic segment. Brand safety is another issue of whether or not the ad was produced in the context of being unethical or having offensive content. Recognizing fraud when an ad is exposed is another challenge marketers face. This relates to invalid traffic as premium sites are more effective at detecting fraudulent traffic, although non-premium sites are more so the problem. [ 61 ] Channels Digital Marketing Channels are systems based on the Internet that can create, accelerate, and transmit product value from producer to a consumer terminal, through digital networks. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Digital marketing is facilitated by multiple Digital Marketing channels, as an advertiser one's core objective is to find channels which result in maximum two-way communication and a better overall ROI for the brand. There are multiple digital marketing channels available namely: [ 66 ] Affiliate marketing - Affiliate marketing is perceived to not be considered a safe, reliable, and easy means of marketing through online platforms. This is due to a lack of reliability in terms of affiliates that can produce the demanded number of new customers. As a result of this risk and bad affiliates, it leaves the brand prone to exploitation in terms of claiming commission that isn't honestly acquired. Legal means may offer some protection against this, yet there are limitations in recovering any losses or investment. Despite this, affiliate marketing allows the brand to market towards smaller publishers and websites with smaller traffic. Brands that choose to use this marketing often should beware of such risks involved and look to associate with affiliates in which rules are laid down between the parties involved to assure and minimize the risk involved. [ 67 ] Digital advertising technologies support the real-time bidding infrastructure used in digital display advertising [ 68 ] Display advertising – As the term implies, online display advertising deals with showcasing promotional messages or ideas to the consumer on the internet. This includes a wide range of advertisements like advertising blogs, networks, interstitial ads, contextual data, ads on search engines, classified or dynamic advertisements, etc. The method can target specific audience tuning in from different types of locals to view a particular advertisement, the variations can be found as the most productive element of this method. Email marketing - Email marketing in comparison to other forms of digital marketing is considered cheap. It is also a way to rapidly communicate a message such as their value proposition to existing or potential customers. Yet this channel of communication may be perceived by recipients to be bothersome and irritating especially to new or potential customers, therefore the success of email marketing is reliant on the language and visual appeal applied. In terms of visual appeal, there are indications that using graphics/visuals that are relevant to the message which is attempting to be sent, yet less visual graphics to be applied with initial emails are more effective in-turn creating a relatively personal feel to the email. In terms of language, the style is the main factor in determining how captivating the email is. Using a casual tone invokes a warmer, gentler and more inviting feel to the email, compared to a more formal tone. Search engine marketing – Search engine marketing (SEM) is a form of Internet marketing that involves the promotion of websites by increasing their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) primarily through paid advertising. SEM may incorporate Search engine optimization , which adjusts or rewrites website content and site architecture to achieve a higher ranking in search engine results pages to enhance pay per click (PPC) listings. Social Media Marketing – The term 'Digital Marketing' has a number of marketing facets as it supports different channels used in and among these, comes the Social Media. When we use social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Google+, etc.) to market a product or service, the strategy is called Social Media Marketing. It is a procedure wherein strategies are made and executed to draw in traffic for a website or to gain the attention of buyers over the web using different social media platforms. Social networking service – A social networking service is an online platform which people use to build social networks or social relations with other people who share similar personal or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections In-game advertising – In-Game advertising is defined as the ""inclusion of products or brands within a digital game."" [ 69 ] The game allows brands or products to place ads within their game, either in a subtle manner or in the form of an advertisement banner. There are many factors that exist in whether brands are successful in the advertising of their brand/product, these being: Type of game, technical platform, 3-D and 4-D technology, game genre, congruity of brand and game, prominence of advertising within the game. Individual factors consist of attitudes towards placement advertisements, game involvement, product involvement, flow, or entertainment. The attitude towards the advertising also takes into account not only the message shown but also the attitude towards the game. Dependent on how enjoyable the game is will determine how the brand is perceived, meaning if the game isn't very enjoyable the consumer may subconsciously have a negative attitude towards the brand/product being advertised. In terms of Integrated Marketing Communication ""integration of advertising in digital games into the general advertising, communication, and marketing strategy of the firm"" [ 69 ] is important as it results in a more clarity about the brand/product and creates a larger overall effect. Online public relations – The use of the internet to communicate with both potential and current customers in the public realm. Video advertising – This type of advertising in terms of digital/online means are advertisements that play on online videos e.g., YouTube videos.  This type of marketing has seen an increase in popularity over time. [ 70 ] Online Video Advertising usually consists of three types: Pre-Roll advertisements which play before the video is watched, Mid-Roll advertisements which play during the video, or Post-Roll advertisements which play after the video is watched. [ 71 ] Post-roll advertisements were shown to have better brand recognition in relation to the other types, where-as ""ad-context congruity/incongruity plays an important role in reinforcing ad memorability"". [ 70 ] Due to selective attention from viewers, there is the likelihood that the message may not be received. [ 72 ] The main advantage of video advertising is that it disrupts the viewing experience of the video and therefore there is a difficulty in attempting to avoid them. How a consumer interacts with online video advertising can come down to three stages: Pre attention, attention, and behavioral decision. [ 73 ] These online advertisements give the brand/business options and choices. These consist of length, position, adjacent video content which all directly affect the effectiveness of the produced advertisement time, [ 70 ] therefore manipulating these variables will yield different results. The length of the advertisement has shown to affect memorability where-as a longer duration resulted in increased brand recognition. [ 70 ] This type of advertising, due to its nature of interruption of the viewer, it is likely that the consumer may feel as if their experience is being interrupted or invaded, creating negative perception of the brand. [ 70 ] These advertisements are also available to be shared by the viewers, adding to the attractiveness of this platform. Sharing these videos can be equated to the online version of word by mouth marketing, extending number of people reached. [ 74 ] Sharing videos creates six different outcomes: these being ""pleasure, affection, inclusion, escape, relaxation, and control"". [ 70 ] As well, videos that have entertainment value are more likely to be shared, yet pleasure is the strongest motivator to pass videos on. Creating a 'viral' trend from a mass amount of a brand advertisement can maximize the outcome of an online video advert whether it be positive or a negative outcome. Native Advertising – This involves the placement of paid content that replicates the look, feel, and oftentimes, the voice of a platform's existing content. It is most effective when used on digital platforms like websites, newsletters, and social media. Can be somewhat controversial as some critics feel it intentionally deceives consumers. [ 75 ] Content Marketing – This is an approach to marketing that focuses on gaining and retaining customers by offering helpful content to customers that improves the buying experience and creates brand awareness.  A brand may use this approach to hold a customer's attention with the goal of influencing potential purchase decisions. [ 76 ] Sponsored Content – This utilises content created and paid for by a brand to promote a specific product or service. [ 77 ] Inbound Marketing – a market strategy that involves using content as a means to attract customers to a brand or product. Requires extensive research into the behaviors, interests, and habits of the brand's target market. [ 78 ] SMS Marketing : Although the popularity is decreasing day by day, still SMS marketing plays huge role to bring new user, provide direct updates, provide new offers etc. Push Notification : In this digital era, Push Notification responsible for bringing new and abandoned customer through smart segmentation. Many online brands are using this to provide personalised appeals depending on the scenario of customer acquisition. It is important for a firm to reach out to consumers and create a two-way communication model, as digital marketing allows consumers to give back feedback to the firm on a community-based site or straight directly to the firm via email. [ 79 ] Firms should seek this long-term communication relationship by using multiple forms of channels and using promotional strategies related to their target consumer as well as word-of-mouth marketing. [ 79 ] Benefits of digital marketing Possible benefits of digital marketing include: any information that is needed is accessible at any time and/or place [ 80 ] surpasses internet marketing and also possesses alternatives choices without the internet needed [ 81 ] top in presenting beneficial ways and features that reach, inform, engage, offer, and sell services and products to consumers [ 80 ] businesses can attain data that present target audiences based on their age, location, interests, and education [ citation needed ] low investment, the cost per lead is 61% less expensive than traditional marketing [ 82 ] able to reach every mobile user, there are over 14 billion worldwide mobile devices and with a projection to grow to almost 18 billion by the year 2024 [ 82 ] Regulation Digital marketing used to rely primarily on self-regulation included in the ICC Code, [ 83 ] which included rules that apply to marketing communications using digital interactive media. However, self-regulation has proved largely ineffective, [ 84 ] [ 85 ] leading to the consolidation of market power in a few firms, including Google , which has been determined to hold monopolies in search marketing and digital advertising. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] While self-regulation codes still exist, government regulation is increasing in multiple jurisdictions, including California's legislation on targeting advertising online. [ 88 ] In Europe, digital marketing is regulated through multiple codes, of which the most important is the Digital Services Act , [ 89 ] which entered into force on 17 February, 2024. Other regulations focus on user privacy and data management such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). [ 90 ] Strategy Planning Digital marketing planning is a term used in marketing management.  It describes the first stage of forming a digital marketing strategy for the wider digital marketing system . The difference between digital and traditional marketing planning is that it uses digitally based communication tools and technology such as Social, Web, Mobile, Scannable Surface. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] Nevertheless, both are aligned with the vision, the mission of the company and the overarching business strategy. [ 93 ] Stages of planning Dr. Dave Chaffey, an author on marketing topics, has suggested that successful digital marketing strategies have do digital marketing planning (DMP), which is a three-stage approach: Opportunity, Strategy, and Action. This generic strategic approach often has phases of situation review, goal setting, strategy formulation, resource allocation and monitoring. [ 93 ] Opportunity To create an effective DMP, a business first needs to review the marketplace and set ""SMART"" (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) objectives. [ 94 ] They can set SMART objectives by reviewing the current benchmarks and key performance indicators (KPIs) of the company and competitors. It is pertinent that the analytics used for the KPIs be customized to the type, objectives, mission, and vision of the company. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] Companies can scan for marketing and sales opportunities by reviewing their own outreach as well as influencer outreach. This means they have competitive advantage because they are able to analyse their co-marketers influence and brand associations. [ 97 ] To seize the opportunity, the firm should summarize its current customers' personas and purchase journey from this they are able to deduce their digital marketing capability. [ 98 ] Strategy A planned digital strategy is where a company expresses clearly what they are offering customers online e.g., brand positioning. The marketing mix is a framework which can be used to facilitate this. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] Action The third and final stage requires the firm to set a budget and management systems. These must be measurable touchpoints, such as the audience reached across all digital platforms. Furthermore, marketers must ensure the budget and management systems are integrating the paid, owned, and earned media of the company. [ 101 ] The Action and final stage of planning also requires the company to set in place measurable content creation e.g. oral, visual or written online media. [ 102 ] Understanding the market One way marketers can reach out to consumers and understand their thought process is through what is called an empathy map. An empathy map is a four-step process. The first step is through asking questions that the consumer would be thinking in their demographic. The second step is to describe the feelings that the consumer may be having. The third step is to think about what the consumer would say in their situation. The final step is to imagine what the consumer will try to do based on the other three steps. This map is so marketing teams can put themselves in their target demographics shoes. [ 103 ] Web Analytics are also a very important way to understand consumers. They show the habits that people have online for each website. [ 104 ] One particular form of these analytics is predictive analytics which helps marketers figure out what route consumers are on. This uses the information gathered from other analytics and then creates different predictions of what people will do so that companies can strategize on what to do next, according to the people's trends. [ 105 ] Consumer behavior: the habits or attitudes of a consumer that influences the buying process of a product or service. [ 106 ] Consumer behavior impacts virtually every stage of the buying process specifically in relation to digital environments and devices. [ 106 ] Predictive analytics: a form of data mining that involves using existing data to predict potential future trends or behaviors. [ 107 ] Can assist companies in predicting future behavior of customers. Buyer persona: employing research of consumer behavior regarding habits like brand awareness and buying behavior to profile prospective customers. [ 107 ] Establishing a buyer persona helps a company better understand their audience and their specific wants/needs. Marketing Strategy: strategic planning employed by a brand to determine potential positioning within a market as well as the prospective target audience. It involves two key elements: segmentation and positioning. [ 107 ] By developing a marketing strategy, a company is able to better anticipate and plan for each step in the marketing and buying process. Sharing economy The ""sharing economy"" refers to an economic pattern that aims to obtain a resource that is not fully used. [ 108 ] Nowadays, the sharing economy has had an unimagined effect on many traditional elements including labor, industry, and distribution system. [ 108 ] This effect is not negligible that some industries are obviously under threat. [ 108 ] [ 109 ] The sharing economy is influencing the traditional marketing channels by changing the nature of some specific concept including ownership, assets, and recruitment. [ 109 ] Digital marketing channels and traditional marketing channels are similar in function that the value of the product or service is passed from the original producer to the end user by a kind of supply chain. [ 110 ] Digital Marketing channels, however, consist of internet systems that create, promote, and deliver products or services from producer to consumer through digital networks. [ 111 ] Increasing changes to marketing channels has been a significant contributor to the expansion and growth of the sharing economy. [ 111 ] Such changes to marketing channels has prompted unprecedented and historic growth. [ 111 ] In addition to this typical approach, the built-in control, efficiency and low cost of digital marketing channels is an essential features in the application of sharing economy. [ 110 ] Digital marketing channels within the sharing economy are typically divided into three domains including, e-mail, social media, and search engine marketing or SEM. [ 111 ] E-mail – A form of direct marketing characterized as being informative, promotional, and often a means of customer relationship management. [ 111 ] Organization can update the activity or promotion information to the user by subscribing the newsletter mail that happened in consuming. Success is reliant upon a company's ability to access contact information from its past, present, and future clientele. [ 111 ] Social Media – Social media has the capability to reach a larger audience in a shorter time frame than traditional marketing channels. [ 111 ] This makes social media a powerful tool for consumer engagement and the dissemination of information. [ 111 ] Search Engine Marketing or SEM – Requires more specialized knowledge of the technology embedded in online platforms. [ 111 ] This marketing strategy requires long-term commitment and dedication to the ongoing improvement of a company's digital presence. [ 111 ] Other emerging digital marketing channels, particularly branded mobile apps, have excelled in the sharing economy. [ 111 ] Branded mobile apps are created specifically to initiate engagement between customers and the company. This engagement is typically facilitated through entertainment, information, or market transaction.
